## **Lindsay Gould \- November 2024 ★☆☆☆☆**

TL;DR \- Charming atmosphere, tragic sandwich. I had high hopes for The Store at Five Corners... it's close by, it's beautiful inside, and the vibe immediately makes you want to settle in with a good sandwich and a coffee. Unfortunately, the food didn't live up to any of that promise. We came in excited for lunch and ended up genuinely disappointed. My sandwich was, to put it gently, joyless. The bread wasn't toasted, the cheese wasn't melted, and the whole thing felt rushed and cold \- the culinary equivalent of being left on 'read.' When you're charging $16 for a sandwich, I don't think it's too much to expect basic warmth, texture, or, frankly, care. The ambiance? Chef's kiss. The food? Still waiting for the chef's kiss. It's clear they've put heart into the space, but the kitchen feels like it missed the memo. I left wishing the food matched the charm, because I really wanted to love this place.

We went to the Five Corners yesterday at noon as it is close to where we are staying. We wanted to buy a sandwich to take with us as we were going to the Norman Rockwell Museum. We asked for a cheese sandwich with Swiss cheese, tomatoes, lettuce and cucumber on sourdough bread and we paid $14 for the sandwich. The bread was dry, it included two squares of cheddar cheese and a slice of tomato. No lettuce, no mayonnaise and no cucumber. What a ripoff. We are going back to ask for your money back. Never again.

## **Positive Google Reviews (via aggregators)**

**★★★★★** This is a place that is food obsessed. Beautifully composed sandwiches. Nicely curated pantry and frozen food selections. Service with a smile. Warm and inviting atmosphere. We had a leisurely lunch. Crispy chicken sandwich was juicy and flavorful. The OG egg sandwich was filling and perfectly cooked scrambled eggs. Chicken noodle soup had a rich concentrated flavor that's clearly homemade. And dare I say better than my mom's. Great stopover\! Will be back.

**★★★★★** This historic locale has been resurrected into a must-stop visit for anyone on 43 or 7 in the Berkshires. We've gotten everything from buttery French croissants to unique African spices and it's worth a sit down on the sunny porch to enjoy the view. We choose to stop here over any other food spot closer into Williamstown (hint: pick something up here before visiting the museum of your choice).

**★★★★★** Delicious breakfast\! Very cute and cozy store, with fresh produce, store goods, great coffee selection, and fresh food\! Breakfast sandwiches had fresh tomatoes and lettuce with yummy aioli. Both indoor and outdoor seating.

**★★★★☆** I went home with a few butter croissants and a few cream cheese and berry croissants and they were magnificent. A little pricey for the items on the shelves but I recognized many of the brands and they are high quality. I'll be back for sure to try something from the kitchen.

**★★★★☆** Just stopped in for coffee and pastry. Great find. Hasn't been open in a while. Glad to see it up and running. Nice atmosphere to sit and have coffee or something light to eat.

**★★★★★** Stopped here after a ride on the rail trail and got a ham and cheese sandwich that was ridiculously good\! They have pickled veg on the side you might want to ask for an extra cup because that stuff is great on the sandwich\! Friendly fast service\!

**★★★★★** What a find, on our return from The Clark museum we had a delightful smoked corn chowder, and created our own artisanal sandwich\! The staff was super and let me not forget Earl Grey cake the best I've had outside of Great Britain. What a true treat.

**★★★★★** Okay, I have lived in the W-town area my whole life and seen all the different ways this store has been run. For the first time in my almost 40 years, there is finally someone running it who knows what they are doing. There has never been regular people food or offerings here. It's always super uppity food that isn't good and no one in town wants to eat. The store quickly folds because no one goes. Everyday I drive by lately the place is packed. So I decided to drop in with my toddler for some lunch/breakfast. What a change\! Good food that anyone would like to eat\! Prices that are reasonable mixed with quality ingredients you won't find at the local diners.

**★★★★☆** I'm so glad I stopped by on my way back home. The iced coffee was smooth and not fruity (my preference). The breakfast sandwich was okay \- the scrambled egg was overcooked for my taste and the bagel a little too toasted. Otherwise it was tasty. The space is spacious with plenty of places to sit. They have a curated little market so I bought some nectarines, a small watermelon, wine, and tomatillo salsa. Of course it was way more expensive than Shop Rite; however, I like supporting small independent businesses.

OPEN\! And Great\! It's back and better than ever. Great sandwiches, soups, salads, coffee, tea and pastries. Lots of space in a heritage building that has been lovingly restored. Good WiFi. Clean toilets \-- both handicap. Plus it's a small grocer with local and not-so-local items. If it is a casual breakfast or lunch, this is your spot. There's also outdoor seating overlooking an orchard.

## **ROB C \- September 2019 ★★★★★**

Great Pit Stop\! Stopped in for breakfast while in town for the weekend. Had an egg/bacon/cheese on ciabatta bread. It was very delicious. The iced coffee was also on point\! Strong but not too bitter and plenty of variations for even the seasoned coffee drinker. We would stop in again and recommend the spot to anyone nearby.

## **Alice P \- February 2020 ★★★★★**

Adorable. We stopped by just to take a peek inside. They have some neat gifts. We did not eat there but the food that was being served looked amazing. Cute little place to stop.

**★★★★☆** We had a great croissant sandwich here. The hibiscus tea was delicious. Lemon bars were soooo good. Love the atmosphere, old wood beams and wooden tables.

**★★★★☆** Their chicken sandwich is up there with the best of them.

**★★★★☆** Great to see the store reopen and continue to offer a menu that is focused on local products and a relaxed atmosphere. Breakfast and lunch are available, we tried the Hummus sandwich but found too many flavors happening, should have done the build your own version to choose the sourdough. Recommend the Green Bee soda and the local produce.

## **Wanderlog Reviews**

**★★★★★** Great cafe & general store vibe. Plenty of bakery treats. The brown butter chocolate chip cookie was awesome, next time I'm going to ask to have it warmed. The breakfast pizza was yummy, added a dash of hot sauce and loved it. The egg souffle sandwich was huge and so tasty. Great coffee and tea selections. Friendly staff and quick.

**★★★★☆** Great store somewhat out of the way. Great tasty food \- a bit slow but makes up for it in taste. Also a bit expensive, but good quality. Highly recommend the baked goods cooked on site daily \- very nice place to go in the morning for a scone and coffee. Lots of gluten free options for prepared or on-menu foods. Also a store component selling all types of things \- good wine selection, good cheeses, beers, ciders, chips, socks, soap, etc... mostly all local. Very old place as well.

**Edison S. \- October 12, 2024:** Visited a charming country store/restaurant with limited seating, but managed to snag stools at a bar facing the front window. Enjoyed live bluegrass music from a budding guitar circle on a Sunday afternoon. Indulged in delicious sandwiches and plan to return when in the Berkshires.

**Sy B. \- April 22, 2024:** great food
