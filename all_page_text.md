At the corner of Five Roads (yes, five! Not just four!)
Stood a rickety, wonderful, old country Store.
It had stood there for ages—two hundred and MORE!
But it sat there all dusty. It sat there all sad.
The shelves were all empty. The windows looked bad.

---

# Page 2

Then along came young Corey, a chef with a dream,
With his pans and his spatulas, all shiny and clean.
"I will OPEN this Store!" Corey said with delight.
"I'll make sandwiches, coffees! I'll set this place RIGHT!"

---

# Page 3

So he scrubbed and he polished from ceiling to floor,
He hung up new menus and opened the door!
The neighbors came running! The farmers came too!
They said, "Corey! Oh Corey! We've been WAITING for you!"

---

# Page 4

For three wonderful years, Corey cooked in that place.
He served soups and he served scones with a smile on his face.
The locals would gather with coffee in hand,
And Corey thought, "Life here is perfectly grand!"

---

# Page 5

Corey checked his phone with growing delight—
The reviews were coming in day and night!
A place that feels good, that's what they found,
The warmest reviews spreading around!

---

# Page 6

'Beautifully composed sandwiches!'
'Food obsessed in the best way!'
typed another neighbor with a smile!
'What a find!'
The praise for Corey floated everywhere!
His phone buzzed and pinged with each new review,
And cars overflowed his tiny parking lot too!

---

# Page 7

'Great baked goods!' 'Crispy chicken sandwich!'
'Worth the stop!' The five-star ratings just wouldn't stop!
And Corey stood beaming in his kitchen so bright,
Like bathed in holographic light.

# Page 8

The tablet glowed bright with review after review,
Each one more delightful than the last one he knew!
In the center, one comment made Corey's heart sing:
"Finally someone who KNOWS what they're doing!"
Around it, more praises came flooding the screen,
The nicest reviews that he'd ever seen!
From "Captain of this ship" to "Best croissant in life"—
He couldn't wait to share this with Emily, his wife!
"The place is now PACKED!" wrote a forty-year neighbor,
"Worth every penny!" praised those who would savor
His crispy fried chicken, his sandwiches divine,
His coffee, his soups—everything was just fine!

"My favorite café!" and "Such welcoming vibes!"
"This place lifts my mood!" all the visitors scribe.
The journal pages filled up, line after line,
With praise for his cooking and space so divine.
QUOTES FROM REAL JOURNAL ENTRIES:
"Worth the drive!"
"Delicious! So neat!"
"Great spot for a break on a backcountry ride!"
"My compliments to the chef!"

But the money was tight—oh, so terribly tight!
He'd count up his pennies by dim kitchen light.
The electric bill ZOOMED like a bird to the sky,
And the dollars went OUT faster than they came by.

---

# Page 12

Then the road crews arrived with their cones and their trucks,
And they dug up the crossroads—oh, what rotten luck!
"A ROUNDABOUT!" they cried. "It will take a whole year!"
And the customers vanished. They just... disappeared.

---

# Page 13

Still Corey kept cooking through summer and fall.
But then came October—a dark, dreadful day—
When the water turned BAD in the worst sort of way!
"E. COLI!" they shouted. "Don't drink! Do not sip!"

---

# Page 14

He closed for a day. Then he opened once more.
But in NOVEMBER it happened AGAIN at the Store!
The food in the freezer went bad, one by one.
The customers stopped coming. The cooking was done.

---

# Page 15

And Corey sat down in the quiet café,
Convinced that his dream had just faded away.
Three years of his life in this Store that he'd loved.
The roundabout pushed and the water had shoved.

---

# Page 16

Now Corey must go, though it hurt quite a lot.
He whispered, "Goodbye, to my favorite spot."
He stood there alone as the sun sank away...
But WAIT! What was THAT? At the end of the day?

---

# Page 17

He turned and he saw them—his family, his CREW!
Running toward him and shouting, "We're HERE! We're here, too!"
There was Emily first, with her smile like the sun,
She said, "Oh my darling, you're NOT nearly done!"

---

# Page 18

"This chapter is closing, but here's the great news:
A NEW book is starting—and YOU get to choose!"
Then in burst THE SUPER THREE—oh, what a team!
Remi, Oona, and Zephyr, all ready to DREAM!

---

# Page 19

"Papa," said Zephyr (the littlest one),
"You can do ANYTHING now that you're done!
You could fly to the MOON! You could dance! You could sing!
You're our dad—and our dad can do ANYTHING!"

---

# Page 20

And Emily laughed and she pulled out a list—
A list that was long, that went TWIST after TWIST!
"We brainstormed," she grinned, "all the things you could BE!
So sit down and listen—from US, your family!"

---

# Page 21

"You could be an ASTRONAUT!" Zephyr declared,
"Flying through space in a rocket ship—THERE!
You'd float past the planets, you'd wave at the stars,
You'd open a SPACE CAFÉ way out on Mars!"

---

# Page 22

"Or a PUNK ROCK GUITARIST!" shouted Remi with glee,
"Up on stage with the lights and the crowd screaming 'WHEEEE!'
With your spiked leather jacket and mohawk so tall,
You'd ROCK every stage! You'd ROCK one and all!"

---

# Page 23

"You could captain a SHIP!" shouted Oona with cheer,
"Sailing the seas without worry or fear!
You'd sing to your sailors a song of the sea:
'What do you DO with a drunken sailor?'—key of C!"

---

# Page 24

"You could be a CRYPTO MOGUL!" the Super Three said,
"Buying Bitcoins and NFTs out of your head!
You'd automate trades using ChatGPT—
Make BILLIONS one day, lose it all by day three!"

---

# Page 25

"You could test SELF-DRIVING CARS!" Zephyr proclaimed,
"Just ride around in them! You'd never be blamed!
If they run over a garden, a mailbox, a bagel cart—
You'd say, 'Wasn't ME! The car's not very smart!'"

---

# Page 26

The list just kept going! The dreams filled the air!
With so many futures—too many to share!
But Corey was smiling, his heart felt so light...
And the family kept dreaming all through the night!

---

# Page 27

"You could PROGRAM COMPUTERS with the help of AI!
Build weird little apps that calculate PI!
Or maybe calculate PIE—'How many slices?'
You could make websites selling spatulas at reasonable prices!"

---

# Page 28

"You could be a LEGO ENGINEER!" Oona cried out,
"Build a life-sized STATUE OF LIBERTY, no doubt!
Or a LEGO SEQUOIA—three hundred feet high!
And when people ask why, you'd say, 'LEGOS! That's why!'"

---

# Page 29

"You could be an ACTOR on screens and TV!
You could star on 'The Bear'—you'd be great, don't you see?
Or be an IRON CHEF! Or a VAMPIRE so scary!
If you practiced real hard, you'd be the next Danny Kaye-ry!"

---

# Page 30

"You could go into POLITICS and run for an office!
You could partner with AOC—she'd be your accomplice!
Debate on a stage! Make speeches! Kiss babies!
You'd be all the rage—you'd drive voters all crazies!"

---

# Page 31

Corey paused for a moment, then said with a grin:
"Or maybe a LIBRARIAN! I could fit in!
An 'Open Scholarship and Research Data Services
Outreach Librarian'—how hard could THAT be?"
But Emily GLARED. "Stay in your LANE!"
So Corey said quickly, "Oh... maybe NOT, then."

---

# Page 32

"You could drive a BIG TRUCK, but always REVERSE!
You'd confuse everyone—but things could be worse!"
"Or be a JOURNALIST! Comfort the afflicted!
Afflict the comfortable! Get 'em convicted!"

---

# Page 33

"You could be a LAWYER to help those in need!
Save chefs from bad leases and nonprofit greed!
Start a class action against mega-corps,
And put ESQUIRE after your name—fancy, of course!"

---

# Page 34

"You could start a PODCAST! Everyone's got one!
Interview your CAT about what cats have done!"
"Or be a TIKTOK STAR doing dances all day!
Get sponsorships for spatulas! Make those brands pay!"

---

# Page 35

"Or be a PRO GAMER in esports so grand!
The best Fortnite player in all of the land!"
"You could fly DELIVERY DRONES across the whole sky!
Or be a PROMPT ENGINEER—tell AI what to say!"

---

# Page 36

"Or a PROFESSIONAL MATTRESS TESTER!" Remi said with a yawn,
"You'd sleep for a living from dusk until dawn!"
The ideas kept flowing like rivers of dreams...
With MORE wild careers than you'd EVER have seen!

---

# Page 37

"Uma Thurman's HAMSTER GUARD!" cried Zephyr with glee,
"A Maine LOBSTER FISHERMAN sailing the sea!"
"PRE-K CHILDCARE!" "GUITAR TUTOR too!"
"GWAR'S BLOOD CANNON GUY!" The ideas just grew!

---

# Page 38

"You could test WATER SLIDES—wheeeee!—all day long!"
"Or TAG SHOWS FOR NETFLIX! Just say what's wrong!"
"Or be a PROFESSIONAL LINE-STANDER for pay!
Wait in lines for rich people—stand there ALL day!"

---

# Page 39

"You could dive for GOLF BALLS at the bottom of ponds!"
"Or teach YOGA TO DOGS—downward dog, we're so fond!"
"Or build a FOOD TRUCK EMPIRE spanning the nation!
Serving tacos and burritos at every location!"

---

# Page 40

"Your FACE could be famous on stock photos worldwide!
On PowerPoints and websites—you'd beam far and wide!"
"Or write FORTUNE COOKIES! Tiny wisdom galore!"
"Or design MINI GOLF COURSES—who could ask more?"

---

# Page 41

"You could yodel on mountains! Teach pigeons to WALTZ!
You could open a shop selling nothing but SALTS!"
"You could be an INVENTOR!" the Super Three cried,
"Build a hat that tells JOKES! Skates TEN FEET wide!"

---

# Page 42

Corey's head was now SPINNING with all he had heard!
So many careers! It was almost absurd!
From astronaut, rocker, and sea captain too,
To crypto and TikTok and Lego and... GOO?

---

---

# Page 45

(Okay, maybe not goo. That was Zephyr's idea.
But you get the whole point—the future was CLEAR!)
He looked at his family—his team and his crew.
At Emily's smile. At the Super Three too.

---

# Page 46

At the three little faces so hopeful and bright...
And something inside him switched ON like a light!
His shoulders un-slumped! And his spine became straight!
His frown became grin! And his good became GREAT!

---

# Page 47

"You're RIGHT!" Corey shouted. "This ISN'T the end!
It's just a new corner! A twist! And a BEND!
I don't know what's next—and that's PERFECTLY fine!
The future's unwritten! The future is MINE!"

---

# Page 48

For Corey had something no setback could break:
A family who loved him for EVERYONE'S sake.
Not just when things sparkled, not just when things shined,
But especially NOW, when he'd fallen behind.

---

# Page 49

So out of Five Corners the family did walk—
All five of them laughing and having a talk.
The five roads stretched out to wherever they led,
But the family was TOGETHER—that's all that they said.

---

# Page 50

The Store stood behind them, still lovely and old,
With three years of memories, worth more than gold.
And though they were leaving, they'd never forget
The place where their story began—not yet.

---

# Page 51

And YOU, reading this, if YOUR store ever closes,
If life throws you lemons (or worse—wilted roses),
If roundabouts ruin your road into town,
If bad water comes and your dreams start to drown...

---

# Page 52 - Back Cover

And to you whom adversity has dealt a mortal blow,
With debt, E.coli and unhelpful boards messing with you everywhere you go,
Turn to and put out all your strength of arm and heart and brain,
And just like Chef Corey (and his baked goods), Rise Again!
