We went to The Store at Five Corners and ordered breakfast. We had three orders: an egg and cheddar sandwich on sourdough, scrambled eggs with rye toast and sausage, a side of hash browns, and a side of bacon. The bread on two orders was barely toasted (i.e. mushy), the scrambled eggs were greasy and burned, the bacon was fatty and stringy, the hash browns were very salty (and I'm someone who likes salt), and the sausage was something like tiny kielbasa links. While not incredibly expensive, it was fairly pricey \-- something I'm fine with provided the food is good. We ended up throwing at least half of the food out.  
To boot, the bathroom was filthy, and the clean dishes I asked for when food for three people came family style/two plates short were greasy to the touch as I carried them presumably freshly washed to the table.  
On a bright note, the staff were lovely. The women at the counter were fun, friendly, and very helpful.  
Other than to buy specialty butter or wine, I can't imagine a reason to eat a meal there again, which is a shame as I will be going by there regularly as it's between home and my son's college.

A lovely gift shop that also serves breakfast and lunch. They offer grocery items, beer, and wine, along with art for sale and live music. The space is beautifully decorated, and the service was friendly. It has a great vibe \-- hip, artsy, and quaint.

\*\*DISCLOSURE STATEMENT\*\*  
I find aspects of writing this review difficult due to being an Amherst College alum and, therefore, eschewing, forever, all things "Williamstown." You have been informed. :)

I have passed The Store at Five Corners to attend my sons' sporting events for years. Today I broke down and tried it for lunch en route to a track meet. I cannot tell you how happy I am to have visited, and how disappointed I am to have wasted a decade not frequenting this place.

It's a Normal Rockwell-esq, quaint and rustic colonial country store. The staff was simply outstanding. Local, authentic, attentive, personable yet professional and added to my experience (I wish I had gotten their names).

They have delicious looking treats and baked goods, an array of interesting dry goods and unique drinks in a cold case \- but the main focus is their breakfast and lunch sandwich, salad, and coffee menu.

The list of offerings does not go on for days. It's efficient, and clearly allows them to be good at 12 things \- rather than meh at 30\.

I ordered possibly the greatest plate of food I've ever had in Berkshire County with the white miso hummus and pickled vegetable salad. WOW.

It was tasty, well proportioned and conceived, and balanced well beyond my expectations. I did add chicken at the suggestion of the staff \- and even the chicken was additive. Perfectly cooked (I suspect wonderfully sous vide), tender, all natural, and tasty.

I enjoyed it so much that as soon as my first plate was cleared (yes, you heard that correctly), I ordered a second\!\!\! And, for the record, it was not due to a skimpy portion. It was due to how much I enjoyed my lunch.

It's menued at $15 before chicken addition \- call it $21 all in with protein and tax. So so worth it.

I literally cannot wait to find an excuse to come back to \*GULP\* Williamstown. I believe our spring sports schedule has us back relatively soon.

The staff made me promise to try the falafel next time. I certainly will (very likely with another one of these as well).

Fantastic.

Fabulous deli/store/counter serving restaurant on Route 7, about 30 minutes north of Tanglewood. I'm all about the charm, and this old house with wide plank floors, yummy bakery case display, wine selection, local cheeses and DELICIOUS sandwiches checked all the boxes. Plus it smells like bacon here.

I loved everything about this place\! My family was visiting the area and we were looking for a relaxed, casual breakfast place where we could sit outside with our miniature poodle. This was the perfect choice \- a country store vibe with truly exceptional food. We ordered at the counter and then settled in at a picnic table overlooking a nearby farm. Everything was great. We will definitely be back\!

They have reopened\! And the food is great. You are welcomed by amazing baked goods and the smell of fresh brewed coffee. On the table is fresh produce for sale. Your heart sings and you almost forget that you came in for a sandwich. Silly you.

I actually ended up with the chopped salad. Delicious. Lots of fresh veggies with local flavors that shout at you.

The store is at the intersection of routes 2 and 7\. Well worth the stop.

Welcome back Store at Five Corners.

Previous review (Aug 24, 2018):  
Really enjoyable for lunch, but a bit on the expensive side. Everything is made to order and tastes delicious. This is one of those places where you order at the counter, they give you a number and deliver the food to the table. It has a country store atmosphere and various things you can buy.

I do like that everything is fresh and prepared to order. The menu is unusual and had fun things. (See the menu in the photo.) Be careful however, that you may have to wait if you order something like eggs Benedict that takes time to prepare.

I had the smoked salmon sandwich on gluten free bread. It was pleasant and a nice change.

I think that I will take guests here when they come to visit the Berkshires.

This is a solid breakfast in a very scenic location.the baked goods were delicious, and the ingredients seemed local and fresh in the breakfast plates/sandwiches. Inside there's a sense of history, as if this is the latest incarnation for a fairly established general store. All in all this is a reasonably priced location to wander in for a late breakfast.

There are so many things I could say about this business, but I think I'd run out of space\! DO NOT HESITATE to visit if you love delicious, fresh pastries (both savory and sweet\!) and one of THE BEST freshly made breakfast sandwiches you'll ever eat in your life, and unbelievably incredible coffee\! What a cool store too\! They have lots of things to check out, from different drinks to snacks/food items, and other locally made/designed items. Corey is the Captain of this amazingly run ship. What a nice guy\! And I'm only saying this because I believe everyone needs to taste something so incredible in their lives they literally dream about it. You HAVE TO try their Toffee Butter cookies (This is what I call them. Hopefully I'm saying it correctly). They are pretty sweet, but they're cookies\!\! Treat yourself. You won't be disappointed. Of you have the chance, stop buy, grab a bite to eat, and sit down and take in your surroundings. You won't be sorry that you did. You will probably be upset that you hadn't known about this gem and their lovely staff sooner\! Enjoy and you're welcome\!

A gem in Williamstown.  
Great ambience, food, music, staff, and light from the big windows\! It has a modern country store vibe. I enjoy the setting for work, reading, or just having a quick meal away from the heart of Williamstown. Its distance from town is both the worst and best thing about the store/cafe. Five stars for five corners.

Doing a second review. This grilled cheese with tomato on sourdough was killer\! And it's just so pretty inside this old country store. AND the food comes quickly. Definitely check it out for breakfast or lunch\!

Previous review (Oct 9, 2022):  
Such a lovely space\!\! I live very nearby so I've gotten to taste a lot of things. Great BLT and crispy chicken sandwich. Best croissant I've had in my life (try and snag the one with chocolate hazelnut inside but they go fast). Very good latte but getting a double shot is expensive. I highly recommend it as a stop if you're in town for a bit or a local like me\!

Very cute country store/restaurant\! Only a few places to sit, but we got a couple of stools at a bar top looking out the front window. We were there on a Sunday around noon and there was a guitar picking circle just getting started. About a dozen musicians playing blue grass music among other things. We had sandwiches, that were delicious\! Glad it's open and I will be back when I'm in the Berkshires\!

Went a nice winter drive with my woman and we stopped here on our way back to Brunswick. The place is beautiful and has a old revolutionarytowm house feel as in back on the day settlers stopped here for a bite to eat and brew ha.

Other than that it is very clean and the food is made fresh and they have a coffee/pastry bar as well I went with the clam chowder which was up there on the scale of clam chowders. It was rich heavy and chunky. Also it actually had CLAMS in it\!? I know right clam chowdah' with clams is actually a thing here where everywhere else seems to give you a bowl of potatoes and celery. Anyways it was great and even had a kick to it to freshen up the sinuses. My fair lady got a blueberry muffin that was lusciously light and filled with blueberry.

I heard this reopened and I stopped by for a sandwich. I have several allergies so I asked many questions. While the clerk didn't know the answer, she did go and ask the person in charge. He was helpful and knowledgeable.

The sandwich was made quickly and it was delicious\!

We're a group of out of town visitors staying in a house nearby, and we ended up eating here for 3 separate meals. Each time, the staff was very accommodating with the food allergies in our party and the kids, too (they serve Udi's gluten free sandwich bread and were able to tell us ingredients in other items). Kid sandwiches are just $1.99, and the adults enjoyed their meals as well. We also got sandwiches to go for $4.99.

This cafe was the perfect place for us to both pick up lunches some days and eat lunch out in the back another day (and let the kids run around on the amazingly huge playground). They also sell a decent selection of popsicles and ice cream, too...an all around win. Thanks for the hospitality, the Store at Five Corners\! We hope to be back.

This place is a gem in Williamstown. The layout is open and spacious, plenty of private or community seating. It has such a great vibe. The service is phenomenal and the food is healthy, organic, sourced from local ingredients and tasty above all. I like the store format, local purveyors, third wave coffee, and sustainable practices.

We unfortunately discovered this place on our way out of town. Had we found it earlier we would have come here for breakfast and coffee every morning.

I loved the fruit infused free water selection and the freshly baked goods displayed prominently but subtly. You can take milk, ice cream, pasta, and cheeses to go as well as a nice broad selection of dry goods too\!

We will definitely be back\! This is the kind of place this town needs to cater to foodie, well heeled, environmentally conscious people who care about what they put in their bodies.

Wow. This is a surprising little gem on the NY/MA/VT lines.

Scratch made delicious healthier food made with care and attention and creativity.

Rich soups, hearty variety of rustic breads, baked sweets, made to order fresh sandwiches, hot dishes too.

Alternative eating with good flavors.

Nice friendly service.

Good selection of retail- chips, crackers, juices, soda, etc.

Make it a point to stop in on your way to where your going.

This spot stayed vacant for many years. Finally after many incarnations it's back. First rate breakfast/ lunch bakery. Cool patio. Easy to find.

Recommended.
