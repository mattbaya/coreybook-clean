Corey checked his phone with growing delight—
The reviews were coming in day and night!
"Chef Corey is awesome!"* and "Food's divine!"
"Five stars!" they declared. "This place really does shine!"
And then the review sites that once sat silent awoke,
"5 stars! Thumbs Up! 'Ridiculously Good!"* they wrote.
"Finally someone who knows what they're doing!"* penned others,
And they told all their sisters and brothers.
"Beautifully composed sandwiches!"* typed a fan,
"Food obsessed in the best way!"* wrote another woman or man.
"Service with a smile!"* and "What a find!"*
The compliments poured in of every kind.
From Yelp to Google, from here to there,
The praise for Corey floated everywhere!
His phone buzzed and pinged with each new review,
And cars overflowed his tiny parking lot too!
"Great baked goods!"* "Crispy chicken sandwich!"* "Worth the stop!"*
The five-star ratings just wouldn't stop!
And Corey stood beaming in his kitchen so bright,
Reading reviews by phone's holographic light.
