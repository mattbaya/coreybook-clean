And hikers and bikers and locals came too,
There's Duncan, Ronan, Sherwood, and Matt,
And Bette and Barbara, Cecilia and Paul.
Why even Mary Pope Osborne stopped in for a snack!
And many wrote notes in the journal there too,
All singing his praise after tasting his soups:
"Your pizza is BEST!" and "Sammies divine!"
"This chai and cake made my whole day shine!"
"The food was fire! Bussin bussin, no cap!"*
Young Lucas had written, then came back to nap.
"My favorite café!" and "Such welcoming vibes!"
"This place lifts my mood!" all the visitors scribe.
From Portland came Carol: "Delicious! So neat!"
"A must-stop each autumn!" for their annual treat.
The journal pages filled up, line after line,
With praise for his cooking and space so divine.
