The tablet glowed bright with review after review,
Each one more delightful than the last one he knew!
In the center, one comment made Corey's heart sing:
"Finally someone who KNOWS what they're doing!"
Around it, more praises came flooding the screen,
The nicest reviews that he'd ever seen!
From "Captain of this ship" to "Best croissant in life"—
He couldn't wait to share this with Emily, his wife!
"The place is now PACKED!" wrote a forty-year neighbor,
"Worth every penny!" praised those who would savor
His crispy fried chicken, his sandwiches divine,
His coffee, his soups—everything was just fine!
