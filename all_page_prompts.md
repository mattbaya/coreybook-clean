## PAGE TEXT
At the corner of Five Roads (yes, five! Not just four!)
Stood a rickety, wonderful, old country Store.
It had stood there for ages—two hundred and MORE!
But it sat there all dusty. It sat there all sad.
The shelves were all empty. The windows looked bad.

Create a modern 2D cartoon illustration with cel-shading showing The Store at Five Corners (reference: cartoon-characters/store-cartoon.jpg) looking abandoned but beautiful. The historic building has cream/yellow clapboard siding and dark forest green shutters. The "Store at Five Corners" sign with "Est. 1787" is visible but weathered. Show dusty windows with cobwebs, an empty front porch, and a small crooked "CLOSED" sign in the window. 

Five winding country roads stretch away from the intersection in different directions, creating the distinctive five-way crossroads. In the background, show the rolling Berkshire mountains with autumn colors. A red barn is visible across one of the streets. The sky should be gray and melancholy but not threatening.

The building should look lonely and neglected but waiting to be loved again—dusty and sad, but with inherent beauty and character. Add subtle Seussian touches like slightly wobbly rooflines and an exaggerated chimney, while maintaining the recognizable structure of this real historic building.

## IMAGE PROMPT

**COREY CHARACTER CONSISTENCY - MUST MATCH EXACTLY:**

Illustrate Corey EXACTLY matching the established reference character.

Corey is a late-middle-aged adult man (late 40s to 50s), bald with a high forehead,
clean-shaven, realistic facial structure.

MANDATORY CHARACTER CONSTRAINTS:
- Smaller, slightly tired eyes (NOT large or cute)
- Longer face, defined jawline
- Subtle age lines around eyes and mouth
- Head-to-body ratio realistic (no chibi, no mascot proportions)
- Neck visible and proportional
- Calm, warm smile (not exaggerated)

DO NOT:
- Do not make Corey look young
- Do not enlarge eyes
- Do not smooth facial features
- Do not shorten torso
- Do not stylize toward "cute" or "friendly mascot"

Style matches prior Corey reference sheets exactly.

- COREY: Completely BALD adult male (no hair), round face, navy blue apron, white shirt
- EMILY: CAUCASIAN WHITE adult female, short silver pixie hair, black glasses
- REMI: 11-year-old CAUCASIAN WHITE boy, dark brown straight hair, blue Super3 shirt
- OONA: 11-year-old CAUCASIAN WHITE girl, long honey blonde hair, blue Super3 shirt
- ZEPHYR: 9-year-old CAUCASIAN WHITE girl, light brown shoulder-length hair, blue Super3 shirt
- SUPER3 LOGO: Red diamond shield with yellow "3", letters Z-O-R in corners
- STORE: Cream building with 4 white columns (reference: cartoon-characters/store-cartoon.jpg)
- TOTAL PEOPLE: Maximum 5 (Corey, Emily, Remi, Oona, Zephyr)

**FAMILY CONSISTENCY NOTE**: All family members (Corey, Emily, Remi, Oona, and Zephyr) are CAUCASIAN WHITE with the same light/pale skin tone. This is a white American family.


Create a modern 2D cartoon illustration with cel-shading showing Corey's acting fantasy in FOUR PANELS:
**IMPORTANT**: DO NOT include any text labels like "PANEL 1", "PANEL 2", etc. in the actual image. These labels are for organization only.
**PANEL 1 - "THE BEAR"**: COREY (bald!) in intense kitchen scene wearing chef whites, shouting "YES CHEF!" with dramatic concentration. Include a clapperboard showing "THE BEAR" and the high-stress restaurant atmosphere.
**PANEL 2 - IRON CHEF**: COREY in the Iron Chef stadium with dramatic lighting and flames shooting from his cooking station. He's holding a weird ingredient (MARSHMALLOWS) and looking determined in the competition setting.
**PANEL 3 - VAMPIRE**: COREY in an awkward vampire costume with cape and fangs, fake blood on his chin, but looking more goofy than scary. A frustrated director off to the side is shouting "MORE SCARY!" while Corey tries harder to look menacing but fails adorably.
**PANEL 4 - DANNY KAYE**: COREY in old Hollywood musical style, tap dancing with a top hat, surrounded by stars and spotlights in classic theatrical fashion. He should look joyful and theatrical.
In the background of all panels, show THE SUPER THREE (blue Super3 t-shirts) holding "FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION" signs and cheering their dad on.
Each panel should capture a different acting genre while maintaining Corey's warm personality. The vampire scene should be particularly funny since he's clearly not cut out to be scary.


 with exaggerated expressions, bold panel borders, and bright stage lighting effects. Each panel should have its own color palette - kitchen whites/reds, stadium blues/oranges, gothic purples/blacks, and theatrical golds/reds.

**IMAGE FORMAT**: Generate as a SQUARE image (1:1 aspect ratio).

**IMPORTANT VISUAL REQUIREMENT**: All characters must have expressive, detailed eyeballs - never just dots for eyes. Eyes should be large, expressive, and clearly defined with pupils and emotional detail.

**Art Style**: Modern 2D cartoon style with cel-shading featuring bold outlines, flat colors with cel-shading, clean prominent dark outlines, and sharp shadow edges without gradients.

Create a modern 2D cartoon illustration with cel-shading showing Corey's political fantasy sequence.
The main focus is POLITICIAN COREY (completely bald!) at a campaign rally podium with "COREY 2028" banners, American flags, and confetti falling. He wears an ill-fitting suit (clearly more comfortable in an apron than formal wear) but looks enthusiastic.
Key political elements to include:
- Campaign buttons scattered around reading "COREY FOR SOMETHING!" and "FREE SCONES FOR ALL!"
- A campaign bus in the background with his face prominently displayed
- Signs reading "CHEFS FOR CHANGE!" and "YES WE CAN (COOK)!"
- A platform/podium sign listing his agenda: "1. Better Soup 2. More Nachos 3. Free Coffee"
The classic political moment: COREY KISSING A BABY. The baby should look confused but happy about this political ritual.
THE SUPER THREE (blue Super3 t-shirts) should be visible in the crowd, enthusiastically waving tiny American flags and cheering for "Candidate Dad."
The overall atmosphere should capture political campaign energy but with Corey's food-focused, wholesome approach to politics. Everything should feel slightly absurd but heartwarming - like a chef who accidentally ended up in politics but is trying his best.


 with bold red, white, and blue patriotic colors, clean campaign banners, and exaggerated political rally atmosphere. Confetti and flags should have dynamic movement and energy with bold outlines.

**IMAGE FORMAT**: Generate as a SQUARE image (1:1 aspect ratio).

**IMPORTANT VISUAL REQUIREMENT**: All characters must have expressive, detailed eyeballs - never just dots for eyes. Eyes should be large, expressive, and clearly defined with pupils and emotional detail.

**Art Style**: Modern 2D cartoon style with cel-shading featuring bold outlines, flat colors with cel-shading, clean prominent dark outlines, and sharp shadow edges without gradients.

Corey paused for a moment, then said with a grin:
"Or maybe a LIBRARIAN! I could fit in!
An 'Open Scholarship and Research Data Services

But Emily GLARED. "Stay in your LANE!"
So Corey said quickly, "Oh... maybe NOT, then."

Create a modern 2D cartoon illustration with cel-shading as a TWO-PART PAGE with a dramatic contrast:
**TOP HALF - THE FANTASY**: COREY (bald!) imagining himself as a peaceful librarian in a beautiful library setting. He wears reading glasses and a cozy cardigan, holding a book titled "VERY COMPLICATED RESEARCH DATA." Towering bookshelves surround him, there's a "SHHH!" sign visible, and his desk nameplate shows the absurdly long title "Open Scholarship and Research Data Services Outreach Librarian." He looks content and intellectual.
**BOTTOM HALF - RECORD SCRATCH REALITY**: The fantasy POPS like a soap bubble! EMILY (short silver/gray pixie hair) is GLARING with arms crossed and one eyebrow raised. Her speech bubble reads "STAY IN YOUR LANE!" Corey (completely bald) looks sheepish with his hands up defensively, saying "Maybe not..." The transition should feel like a sudden reality check.
THE SUPER THREE (blue Super3 t-shirts) are visible in the corner, giggling at this family interaction:
- REMI (dark brown straight hair) trying not to laugh
- OONA (long honey blonde hair) with hand over mouth
- ZEPHYR (light brown messy hair) openly giggling
The key joke is that Emily IS an actual librarian in real life, so Corey suggesting HER profession is particularly presumptuous. The contrast between the peaceful fantasy and Emily's sharp reality check should be dramatic and funny.


 with the top half in soft, scholarly colors (warm browns, gentle yellows) and the bottom half with bold, dramatic colors emphasizing Emily's authoritative shutdown. The bubble-pop transition should be visually clear and comedic with sharp shadow edges.

**IMAGE FORMAT**: Generate as a SQUARE image (1:1 aspect ratio).

**TOP SCENE - REVERSE TRUCK DRIVER**: COREY (bald!) driving an enormous 18-wheeler COMPLETELY IN REVERSE down a highway. He's looking over his shoulder, totally calm and focused. Other drivers are BAFFLED and TERRIFIED - show cars swerving, drivers with jaws dropped, and a traffic cop scratching his head in complete confusion. The truck should have a bumper sticker reading "CAUTION: ALWAYS IN REVERSE." REMI (dark brown straight hair, blue Super3 t-shirt) sits in the passenger seat giving a confident thumbs up.
**BOTTOM SCENE - INVESTIGATIVE JOURNALIST**: COREY as a hard-hitting reporter wearing a "PRESS" badge in his hat, holding a notepad and pen. He's asking tough questions to a sweaty politician who is nervously loosening his collar. Headlines should swirl around them reading "COREY BREAKS BIG STORY!" and "TRUTH TO POWER!" The scene should capture that classic investigative journalism energy of holding the powerful accountable.
Both scenes should emphasize Corey's competence in these unusual roles - he's genuinely good at reverse driving (somehow) and serious about investigative journalism. The humor comes from the absurdity of the reverse driving situation and the contrast between chef-turned-journalist.


 with bold, dynamic lines emphasizing movement in the truck scene and dramatic tension in the journalism scene. Use contrasting color palettes - highway blues/grays for the truck scene and newspaper blacks/whites/reds for the journalism scene.

**IMAGE FORMAT**: Generate as a SQUARE image (1:1 aspect ratio).

**IMPORTANT VISUAL REQUIREMENT**: All characters must have expressive, detailed eyeballs - never just dots for eyes. Eyes should be large, expressive, and clearly defined with pupils and emotional detail.

The main focus is LAWYER COREY (bald!) in a sharp suit, pointing dramatically at the defendant's table where EVIL CORPORATE EXECUTIVES cower. These villains should look cartoonish with money bag heads and suits made of dollar bills, representing mega-corporation greed.
Behind Corey: a line of GRATEFUL CLIENTS - chefs in aprons and small business owners looking relieved and thankful for his legal representation.
Key courtroom elements:
- Judge's nameplate reading "JUSTICE"
- Legal books on Corey's table: "FIGHTING THE POWER" and "LEASES FOR DUMMIES"
- A prominent business card: "COREY WENTWORTH, ESQ." in fancy script lettering
- A scoreboard showing "LITTLE GUYS: 47 / MEGA CORPS: 0"
The best detail: OONA (long honey blonde hair, blue Super3 t-shirt) wearing a tiny judge's wig and robes, seriously banging an oversized gavel from the judge's bench, fully committed to her role in this fantasy.
The scene should capture the David vs. Goliath energy of a small-town lawyer taking on corporate power and winning. Corey looks confident and principled, fighting for justice with the backing of the community.

Include visible sound waves emanating from the mics to show they're recording.
**BOTTOM PANEL - TIKTOK STAR**: COREY attempting a silly viral dance with a phone propped up to record him. He should look confused by the dance moves but fully committed to the performance. Surround him with flying SPATULAS and cooking equipment representing his sponsorship deals. Include floating hearts and likes, plus a "VIRAL!" stamp indicator. The scene should capture the absurdity of social media fame.
Both panels should show Corey embracing modern digital media with his characteristic enthusiasm, even when the concepts are slightly outside his comfort zone (especially trying to interview an uninterested cat and learning viral dances).
The contrast between serious podcast production and silly TikTok content should be humorous, showing the range of modern content creation opportunities.

**BOTTOM - SPLIT PANEL**: 
**Left - DRONE PILOT**: COREY at a control station wearing aviator goggles on his bald head, piloting a fleet of delivery drones across the sky. One drone should be accidentally dropping a package into a swimming pool as a humorous mishap.
**Right - PROMPT ENGINEER**: COREY at a sleek computer setup typing commands, with an AI robot generating wonderfully weird outputs like cats riding unicorns and poetry about cheese. Include the title "PROFESSIONAL ROBOT WHISPERER" to emphasize this emerging tech career.
All three scenarios should show Corey mastering different aspects of modern technology - competitive gaming, drone operation, and AI direction. The mood should be exciting and forward-looking, showing how technology creates new career possibilities.


 with bright, high-tech color schemes - gaming arena blues and neons, sky blues for drone operation, and futuristic metallics for the AI setup. Include lots of technological details with bold outlines and flat colors.

**BUBBLE 1 - UMA THURMAN'S HAMSTER GUARD**:
Show Corey (bald!) in a black Secret Service suit with sunglasses and earpiece, standing protectively next to Uma Thurman (elegant actress) who's gently holding a tiny hamster. Include a "HAMSTER SECURITY" badge and maybe a tiny metal detector for the hamster to walk through. Hollywood red carpet background.
**BUBBLE 2 - MAINE LOBSTER FISHERMAN**:
Corey in yellow rain gear hauling up lobster traps from the ocean. Show the lobster boat named "COREY CHAOS" with "VERONA ISLAND, ME" painted on the stern. One feisty lobster is clawing at Corey's nose while he pulls up the trap! Show the rocky Verona Island, Maine coastline, seagulls overhead, and other caught lobsters with prominent claws in the boat. Ocean spray and authentic Maine fishing atmosphere with Corey's surprised/pained expression from the nose-clawing lobster.
**BUBBLE 3 - PRE-K CHILDCARE TEACHER**:
Corey in a colorful apron reading to a circle of adorable 4-year-olds. Show a bright, cheerful daycare classroom with toys, alphabet blocks, and finger paints. Name tag reads "MR. COREY." Children should look engaged and happy.
**BUBBLE 4 - GUITAR TUTOR**:
Corey (bald!) teaching guitar to Matt in a music room. Corey is holding his ears in pain while Matt (much thinner than cartoon-characters/matt.jpg reference) enthusiastically sings "I'm a Vegetarian Now!" while playing guitar badly. Show a wall calendar filled with lesson dates for various instruments: "TUBA - MON", "BAGPIPES - WED", "DIDGERIDOO - FRI". Include various instruments around the room (tuba, bagpipes, didgeridoo visible). Matt should look happy and oblivious while Corey suffers.
**BUBBLE 5 - GWAR SPECIAL EFFECTS ENGINEER**:
Corey wearing safety goggles and black metal t-shirt, pouring a massive vat of fake blood into a theatrical cannon on a concert stage. GWAR band members in grotesque sci-fi monster costumes playing brutal music in background. Theatrical, over-the-top metal concert atmosphere with fake blood effects (cartoonish, not realistic).
**THE FAMILY** should be in the center:
- **Remi with dark brown straight hair, Super3 shirt) pointing excitedly at GWAR scene
- **Oona** (honey blonde hair, Super3 shirt) fascinated by lobster fishing  
- **Zephyr** (light brown hair, Super3 shirt) with BIGGEST SMILE at hamster guard
- **Emily** (short silver hair) looking amused but slightly overwhelmed
Reference cartoon-characters/store-cartoon.jpg for accurate building design.


 with each fantasy bubble having its own color scheme - Hollywood glam, Maine ocean blues, cheerful daycare colors, music room warm tones (with Corey's pain), and dark metal concert atmosphere. The family should be the stable center while the career bubbles swirl around them with increasing creativity and absurdity.

Create a modern 2D cartoon illustration with cel-shading showing THREE PANELS of creative career opportunities:
**IMPORTANT**: DO NOT include any text labels like "PANEL 1", "PANEL 2", etc. in the actual image. These labels are for organization only.
**PANEL 1 - STOCK PHOTO MODEL**: COREY (bald!) appears in multiple poses on FLOATING POWERPOINT SLIDES around him - pointing at graphs looking impressed, shaking hands, giving thumbs up, and laughing at salad (classic stock photo poses). Each slide should have watermarks. In the background, show a corporate meeting where people are actually using presentations featuring his images. He should be EVERYWHERE, representing the ubiquity of stock photos.
**PANEL 2 - FORTUNE COOKIE WRITER**: COREY at a tiny desk surrounded by MOUNTAINS of fortune paper slips. Show his latest creation: "A SPATULA IN TIME SAVES NINE." Include weird ones scattered around: "BEWARE THE TUESDAY PENGUIN" and "YOUR LUCKY NUMBER IS CHEESE." A fortune cookie factory should be visible churning in the background, mass-producing his wisdom.
**PANEL 3 - MINI GOLF DESIGNER**: COREY standing proudly in an ELABORATE mini golf course with ABSURD obstacles: windmill, loop-de-loop, erupting volcano, whale mouth, castle with moat. Show frustrated golfers attempting impossible shots. Include signage reading "COREY'S EXTREMELY DIFFICULT MINI GOLF" and his designer business card.
Each panel should capture a different type of creative work - visual modeling, written wisdom, and experiential design. The progression should show increasingly complex creative challenges.


 with bright, varied color palettes - corporate blues and whites for stock photos, warm wisdom yellows for fortune cookies, and playful mini golf carnival colors. Each panel should emphasize the creative and slightly absurd nature of these real but unusual careers.

**IMAGE FORMAT**: Generate as a SQUARE image (1:1 aspect ratio).

**IMPORTANT VISUAL REQUIREMENT**: All characters must have expressive, detailed eyeballs - never just dots for eyes. Eyes should be large, expressive, and clearly defined with pupils and emotional detail.

**Art Style**: Modern 2D cartoon style with cel-shading featuring bold outlines, flat colors with cel-shading, clean prominent dark outlines, and sharp shadow edges without gradients.

All five of them laughing and having a talk.
The five roads stretched out to wherever they led,
But the family was TOGETHER—that's all that they said.
