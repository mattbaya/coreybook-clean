Create a modern 2D cartoon illustration with cel-shading BREAKING THE FOURTH WALL - directly addressing and welcoming the reader.

**THE CENTRAL DOOR**: Show a large OPEN DOOR with brilliant golden light pouring through - this represents the door to the future, the door to "what's next." The light should be warm and inviting, pulling the viewer toward possibility.

**THE FAMILY INVITATION**: The family should be visible through or beside the door, all smiling and BECKONING the reader:
- **COREY** (bald!) gesturing "come on!" with welcoming, encouraging arms
- **EMILY** (short silver hair) waving warmly to the reader
- **THE SUPER THREE** (blue Super3 shirt (logo reference: images/super3v3.png)s) jumping excitedly, clearly inviting the reader to join their adventure

**SCATTERED MEMORIES**: Around the door frame, lovingly scatter artifacts from the entire story journey:
- Spatula (from chef days)
- Coffee cup (from the Store)
- Astronaut helmet (from space dreams)
- Guitar (from rock star fantasy, maybe with subtle "Big Dog" reference)
- Captain's hat (from sea captain dreams)
- Fortune cookie (from career possibilities)
- LEGO brick (from engineering dreams)
- Other career symbols representing all the possibilities explored

**DIRECT ADDRESS**: The characters should be looking directly at the VIEWER, making it clear this message is FOR them. The invitation should feel personal and inclusive.

**THE MESSAGE**: "This door is for YOU too. If Corey can transform and find hope, so can you. Come through - the future is waiting."
**IMAGE FORMAT**: Generate as a SQUARE image (1:1 aspect ratio).
**IMPORTANT VISUAL REQUIREMENT**: All characters must have expressive, detailed eyeballs - never just dots for eyes. Eyes should be large, expressive, and clearly defined with pupils and emotional detail.
**Art Style**: Modern 2D cartoon style with cel-shading with brilliant, hopeful colors representing the final moments of this transformative story.
