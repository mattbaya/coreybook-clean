Create a modern 2D cartoon illustration with cel-shading showing WARM FAMILY GROUP HUG - the emotional climax.
**THE EMBRACE**: All five family members in a tight, warm group hug with everyone wrapped around each other:
**CENTRAL FIGURE**: Bald man Corey in the center with tears of joy, navy apron, wearing the biggest smile of the series
**EMILY**: Silver pixie hair woman pressed close to Corey, one hand gently touching his face, eyes closed contentedly, whispering comfort
**THE THREE KIDS**: All wrapped around their parents in blue shirts:
- **REMI**: Brown-haired boy hugging from one side
- **OONA**: Blonde girl squeezing in from the other side  
- **ZEPHYR**: Smallest brown-haired girl pressed against the front
**EMOTIONAL ATMOSPHERE**:
- Golden light radiating outward from the family group
- Small floating hearts drifting upward around them
- Warmest possible colors - golds, soft oranges, gentle pinks
- Everyone's eyes showing pure contentment and love
**THE FEELING**: This is the emotional climax - pure love, family connection, unbreakable bonds, complete security and acceptance.
**IMAGE FORMAT**: Generate as a SQUARE image (1:1 aspect ratio).
**IMPORTANT VISUAL REQUIREMENT**: All characters must have expressive, detailed eyeballs - never just dots for eyes. Eyes should be large, expressive, and clearly defined with pupils and emotional detail.
**Art Style**: Modern 2D cartoon style with cel-shading with bold, dynamic movement lines showing the impact and chaos of the tackle-hug. Bright, celebratory colors emphasizing joy and family connection. The composition should feel energetic and slightly off-balance in the best possible way.
