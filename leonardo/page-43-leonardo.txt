**CENTRAL ACTION**: Bald man Corey with arms spread wide in triumphant pose, huge grin, wearing navy apron, being simultaneously tackle-hugged by all three kids:
- **REMI**: Brown-haired boy grabbing from the left side
- **OONA**: Blonde girl jumping from the right side  
- **ZEPHYR**: Smallest brown-haired girl climbing up the front
- All three kids wearing blue shirts with red diamond Super3 logo
**CAREER SYMBOLS FLOATING**: Around the tackle-hug scene, show floating career symbols representing possibilities:
- Astronaut helmet floating nearby
- Guitar with musical notes
- Captain's hat 
- Judge's gavel
- LEGO bricks scattered around
- Other career symbols from the series
**ENERGY AND MOTION**: 
- Motion lines showing the impact of the tackle-hug
- Joyful chaos with maximum energy

- Bright, warm colors emphasizing celebration
**OVERALL MOOD**: Pure joy, family connection, celebration of transformation, maximum energy and movement.
**IMAGE FORMAT**: Generate as a SQUARE image (1:1 aspect ratio).
**IMPORTANT VISUAL REQUIREMENT**: All characters must have expressive, detailed eyeballs - never just dots for eyes. Eyes should be large, expressive, and clearly defined with pupils and emotional detail.
**Art Style**: Modern 2D cartoon style with cel-shading with the brightest, most hopeful colors of the entire series. The career possibilities should swirl like stars and planets, and the lighting should suggest the dawn of a new chapter. Maximum joy and possibility.
