**THE FEELING**: This is the emotional climax - pure love, family connection, unbreakable bonds, complete security and acceptance.


 with bold, dynamic movement lines showing the impact and chaos of the tackle-hug. Bright, celebratory colors emphasizing joy and family connection. The composition should feel energetic and slightly off-balance in the best possible way.

**IMAGE FORMAT**: Generate as a SQUARE image (1:1 aspect ratio).

**IMPORTANT VISUAL REQUIREMENT**: All characters must have expressive, detailed eyeballs - never just dots for eyes. Eyes should be large, expressive, and clearly defined with pupils and emotional detail.
