Create a modern 2D cartoon illustration with cel-shading delivering a HOPEFUL MESSAGE directly to the reader.

**HEROIC FAMILY POSE**: COREY (bald!) and his family in a welcoming, heroic stance with arms outstretched toward the viewer. They should look like superheroes of hope, offering encouragement:
- **COREY** confident and encouraging, showing he's been where the reader might be
- **EMILY** (short silver hair) with a warm, understanding smile
- **THE SUPER THREE** (blue Super3 shirts) excited and supportive, representing the next generation of possibility

**SWIRLING POSSIBILITIES**: Around them, show translucent, dreamlike images of ALL the career possibilities from the entire series - astronaut, rock star, sea captain, chef, plus all the others. These should represent infinite potential available to anyone, not just Corey.

**THE CAT**: Include a friendly cat sitting nearby (callback to the podcast joke), representing how even our pets can be part of our support system and journey.

**"STARTING BRAND NEW!"**: Display this prominently in warm golden letters, maybe formed from stars or light. This should be the central message - every ending can be a new beginning.

**THE DIRECT MESSAGE**: This should feel like a friend giving a pep talk. The family is saying: "We understand what you're going through. We've been there. And we believe you can do this too."

**THE INVITATION**: Include elements that represent different support systems - "your family beside you (or friends, or your cat)" - showing that everyone has something to build on.





**IMAGE FORMAT**: Generate as a SQUARE image (1:1 aspect ratio).

**IMPORTANT VISUAL REQUIREMENT**: All characters must have expressive, detailed eyeballs - never just dots for eyes. Eyes should be large, expressive, and clearly defined with pupils and emotional detail.

**Art Style**: Modern 2D cartoon style with cel-shading with warm, encouraging colors dominated by golden hope. The family should radiate confidence and support, and the career possibilities should swirl like stars of potential. This is a pep talk in visual form.
