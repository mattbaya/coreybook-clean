## IMAGE PROMPT

**COREY CHARACTER CONSISTENCY - MUST MATCH EXACTLY:**

Illustrate Corey EXACTLY matching the established reference character.

Corey is a late-middle-aged adult man (late 40s to 50s), bald with a high forehead,
clean-shaven, realistic facial structure.

MANDATORY CHARACTER CONSTRAINTS:
- Smaller, slightly tired eyes (NOT large or cute)
- Longer face, defined jawline
- Subtle age lines around eyes and mouth
- Head-to-body ratio realistic (no chibi, no mascot proportions)
- Neck visible and proportional
- Calm, warm smile (not exaggerated)

DO NOT:
- Do not make Corey look young
- Do not enlarge eyes
- Do not smooth facial features
- Do not shorten torso
- Do not stylize toward "cute" or "friendly mascot"

Style matches prior Corey reference sheets exactly.

- COREY: Completely BALD adult male (no hair), round face, navy blue apron, white shirt
- EMILY: CAUCASIAN WHITE adult female, short silver pixie hair, black glasses
- REMI: 11-year-old CAUCASIAN WHITE boy, dark brown straight hair, blue Super3 shirt
- OONA: 11-year-old CAUCASIAN WHITE girl, long honey blonde hair, blue Super3 shirt
- ZEPHYR: 9-year-old CAUCASIAN WHITE girl, light brown shoulder-length hair, blue Super3 shirt
- SUPER3 LOGO: Red diamond shield with yellow "3", letters Z-O-R in corners
- STORE: Cream building with 4 white columns (reference: cartoon-characters/store-cartoon.jpg)
- TOTAL PEOPLE: Maximum 5 (Corey, Emily, Remi, Oona, Zephyr)

**FAMILY CONSISTENCY NOTE**: All family members (Corey, Emily, Remi, Oona, and Zephyr) are CAUCASIAN WHITE with the same light/pale skin tone. This is a white American family.


Create a modern 2D cartoon illustration with cel-shading showing Corey's political fantasy sequence.
The main focus is POLITICIAN COREY (completely bald!) at a campaign rally podium with "COREY 2028" banners, American flags, and confetti falling. He wears an ill-fitting suit (clearly more comfortable in an apron than formal wear) but looks enthusiastic.
Key political elements to include:
- Campaign buttons scattered around reading "COREY FOR SOMETHING!" and "FREE SCONES FOR ALL!"
- A campaign bus in the background with his face prominently displayed
- Signs reading "CHEFS FOR CHANGE!" and "YES WE CAN (COOK)!"
- A platform/podium sign listing his agenda: "1. Better Soup 2. More Nachos 3. Free Coffee"
The classic political moment: COREY KISSING A BABY. The baby should look confused but happy about this political ritual.
THE SUPER THREE (blue Super3 t-shirts) should be visible in the crowd, enthusiastically waving tiny American flags and cheering for "Candidate Dad."
The overall atmosphere should capture political campaign energy but with Corey's food-focused, wholesome approach to politics. Everything should feel slightly absurd but heartwarming - like a chef who accidentally ended up in politics but is trying his best.


 with bold red, white, and blue patriotic colors, clean campaign banners, and exaggerated political rally atmosphere. Confetti and flags should have dynamic movement and energy with bold outlines.

**IMAGE FORMAT**: Generate as a SQUARE image (1:1 aspect ratio).

**IMPORTANT VISUAL REQUIREMENT**: All characters must have expressive, detailed eyeballs - never just dots for eyes. Eyes should be large, expressive, and clearly defined with pupils and emotional detail.

**Art Style**: Modern 2D cartoon style with cel-shading featuring bold outlines, flat colors with cel-shading, clean prominent dark outlines, and sharp shadow edges without gradients.
