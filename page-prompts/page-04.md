For three wonderful years, Corey cooked in that place.
He served soups and he served scones with a smile on his face.
The locals would gather with coffee in hand,
And Corey thought, "Life here is perfectly grand!"

- Longer face, defined jawline
- Subtle age lines around eyes and mouth

- Calm, warm smile (not exaggerated)

DO NOT:
- Do not make Corey look young
- Do not enlarge eyes
- Do not smooth facial features

**FAMILY CONSISTENCY NOTE**: All family members (Corey, Emily, Remi, Oona, and Zephyr) are CAUCASIAN WHITE with the same light/pale skin tone. This is a white American family.


Create a modern 2D cartoon illustration with cel-shading showing The Store at Five Corners (reference: cartoon-characters/store-cartoon.jpg) at its absolute peak of success - the interior café scene in full, glorious operation.

Show the warm wood-paneled walls and the professional silver espresso machine (Nuova Simonelli) prominently featured. Corey (bald, wearing navy blue apron, huge smile) stands proudly behind the counter, handing a steaming bowl of soup to a happy customer.

The glass sunroom addition should be filled with happy neighbors sitting at tables, chatting, laughing, and holding coffee cups. Show steam rising warmly from various dishes. Sunlight pours through the large windows creating a golden, welcoming atmosphere.

Include details like:
- Chalkboard menu listing drinks and food
- Copper pendant lamps glowing warmly
- Display case with fresh pastries and scones
- Local artwork on the walls
- The overall feeling of a thriving community hub

Add a thought bubble showing Corey thinking "Life is grand!" with little hearts and stars around it.





**IMAGE FORMAT**: Generate as a SQUARE image (1:1 aspect ratio).

**IMPORTANT VISUAL REQUIREMENT**: All characters must have expressive, detailed eyeballs - never just dots for eyes. Eyes should be large, expressive, and clearly defined with pupils and emotional detail.

**Art Style**: Modern 2D cartoon style with cel-shading emphasizing pure warmth, community, and contentment. This should be the golden moment - everything Corey dreamed his Store could be. Use warm, saturated colors with bold outlines and flat colors with cel-shading, showing the café bustling with life and happiness.
