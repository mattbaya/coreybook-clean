## PAGE TEXT
Remember young Corey and all his great crew,
And know that THE END can mean STARTING brand new!
With your family beside you (or friends, or your cat),
You can pick yourself up, dust yourself off—just like THAT!

Will he rocket to space? Will he ROCK with a band?
Will he sail the high seas? Will he teach crabs to stand?
Nobody knows! And that's perfectly great!
The places you'll go are the places YOU'LL make!

Create a modern 2D cartoon illustration with cel-shading BREAKING THE FOURTH WALL - directly addressing and welcoming the reader.

**THE CENTRAL DOOR**: Show a large OPEN DOOR with brilliant golden light pouring through - this represents the door to the future, the door to "what's next." The light should be warm and inviting, pulling the viewer toward possibility.

**THE FAMILY INVITATION**: The family should be visible through or beside the door, all smiling and BECKONING the reader:
- **COREY** (bald!) gesturing "come on!" with welcoming, encouraging arms
- **EMILY** (short silver hair) waving warmly to the reader
- **THE SUPER THREE** (blue Super3 shirt (logo reference: images/super3v3.png)s) jumping excitedly, clearly inviting the reader to join their adventure

**SCATTERED MEMORIES**: Around the door frame, lovingly scatter artifacts from the entire story journey:
- Spatula (from chef days)
- Coffee cup (from the Store)
- Astronaut helmet (from space dreams)
- Guitar (from rock star fantasy, maybe with subtle "Big Dog" reference)
- Captain's hat (from sea captain dreams)
- Fortune cookie (from career possibilities)
- LEGO brick (from engineering dreams)
- Other career symbols representing all the possibilities explored

**DIRECT ADDRESS**: The characters should be looking directly at the VIEWER, making it clear this message is FOR them. The invitation should feel personal and inclusive.

**THE MESSAGE**: "This door is for YOU too. If Corey can transform and find hope, so can you. Come through - the future is waiting."





**IMAGE FORMAT**: Generate as a SQUARE image (1:1 aspect ratio).

**IMPORTANT VISUAL REQUIREMENT**: All characters must have expressive, detailed eyeballs - never just dots for eyes. Eyes should be large, expressive, and clearly defined with pupils and emotional detail.

**Art Style**: Modern 2D cartoon style with cel-shading with brilliant golden light as the dominant feature. The door should feel like a portal to possibility, and the family should radiate warmth and inclusion. This is the moment the story becomes interactive and personal.
