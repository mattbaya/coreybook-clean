## IMAGE PROMPT

**COREY CHARACTER CONSISTENCY - MUST MATCH EXACTLY:**

Illustrate Corey EXACTLY matching the established reference character.

Corey is a late-middle-aged adult man (late 40s to 50s), bald with a high forehead,
clean-shaven, realistic facial structure.

MANDATORY CHARACTER CONSTRAINTS:
- Smaller, slightly tired eyes (NOT large or cute)
- Longer face, defined jawline
- Subtle age lines around eyes and mouth
- Head-to-body ratio realistic (no chibi, no mascot proportions)
- Neck visible and proportional
- Calm, warm smile (not exaggerated)

DO NOT:
- Do not make Corey look young
- Do not enlarge eyes
- Do not smooth facial features
- Do not shorten torso
- Do not stylize toward "cute" or "friendly mascot"

Style matches prior Corey reference sheets exactly.

Create a modern 2D cartoon illustration with cel-shading showing CAREER OVERLOAD in a spectacular tornado of possibilities.
**CENTER**: COREY (bald!) sits in the middle with his head SPINNING - include cartoon spin lines around his head! He should look overwhelmed but amazed rather than distressed, like someone who just realized how many possibilities exist in the world.
**SURROUNDING WHIRLWIND**: Create a tornado/hurricane of ALL the career images from the entire series swirling around him:
- Astronaut helmet
- Punk rock guitar (with subtle "Big Dog" sign)
- Captain's hat
- Bitcoin symbols
- Self-driving car
- LEGO bricks
- Movie clapperboard
- Political campaign buttons
- Library books (crossed out with Emily's face glaring)
- Truck driving in reverse
- Notepad (journalist)
- Legal briefcase

- Game controller
- Mattress
- Water slide with splash
- Golf balls
- Dog in yoga pose
- Hot dogs
- Sourdough starter jar
- Hot sauce bottle

- And MORE!
**FAMILY OBSERVERS**: THE SUPER THREE and EMILY watching this wonderful chaos. ZEPHYR should be in the corner holding her drawing labeled "GOO???" still looking hopeful. Emily and the twins should be shaking their heads lovingly at Zephyr's suggestion.
The mood should be joyful overwhelm - like discovering the world is full of infinite amazing possibilities.


 with a rainbow tornado of colors, all the career symbols swirling in organized chaos around central Corey. The spin lines around his head should be dramatic and the overall feeling should be wonder at life's possibilities.

**IMAGE FORMAT**: Generate as a SQUARE image (1:1 aspect ratio).

**IMPORTANT VISUAL REQUIREMENT**: All characters must have expressive, detailed eyeballs - never just dots for eyes. Eyes should be large, expressive, and clearly defined with pupils and emotional detail.

**Art Style**: Modern 2D cartoon style with cel-shading featuring bold outlines, flat colors with cel-shading, clean prominent dark outlines, and sharp shadow edges without gradients.
