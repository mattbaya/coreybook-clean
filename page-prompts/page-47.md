## PAGE TEXT
"You're RIGHT!" Corey shouted. "This ISN'T the end!
It's just a new corner! A twist! And a BEND!
I don't know what's next—and that's PERFECTLY fine!
The future's unwritten! The future is MINE!"
## IMAGE PROMPT

**COREY CHARACTER CONSISTENCY - MUST MATCH EXACTLY:**

Illustrate Corey EXACTLY matching the established reference character.

Corey is a late-middle-aged adult man (late 40s to 50s), bald with a high forehead,
clean-shaven, realistic facial structure.

MANDATORY CHARACTER CONSTRAINTS:
- Smaller, slightly tired eyes (NOT large or cute)
- Longer face, defined jawline
- Subtle age lines around eyes and mouth
- Head-to-body ratio realistic (no chibi, no mascot proportions)
- Neck visible and proportional
- Calm, warm smile (not exaggerated)

DO NOT:
- Do not make Corey look young
- Do not enlarge eyes
- Do not smooth facial features
- Do not shorten torso
- Do not stylize toward "cute" or "friendly mascot"

Style matches prior Corey reference sheets exactly.

- COREY: Completely BALD adult male (no hair), round face, navy blue apron, white shirt
- EMILY: CAUCASIAN WHITE adult female, short silver pixie hair, black glasses
- REMI: 11-year-old CAUCASIAN WHITE boy, dark brown straight hair, blue Super3 shirt
- OONA: 11-year-old CAUCASIAN WHITE girl, long honey blonde hair, blue Super3 shirt
- ZEPHYR: 9-year-old CAUCASIAN WHITE girl, light brown shoulder-length hair, blue Super3 shirt

**FAMILY CONSISTENCY NOTE**: All family members (Corey, Emily, Remi, Oona, and Zephyr) are CAUCASIAN WHITE with the same light/pale skin tone. This is a white American family.


Create a modern 2D cartoon illustration with cel-shading BREAKING THE FOURTH WALL - directly addressing and welcoming the reader while honoring the past.

**MAIN FOCUS**: Looking BACK at the Store from the family's perspective as they pause in their journey forward. The Store at Five Corners (reference: cartoon-characters/store-cartoon.jpg) should glow warmly in the sunset - the cream siding appearing golden in the light, green shutters peaceful, the "Est. 1787" sign visible and honored.

**THE STORE'S DIGNITY**: The building should look peaceful and at rest, not abandoned or sad. It has dignity and beauty, ready for ITS next story too. This isn't about failure - it's about a chapter ending gracefully.

**HAPPY MEMORIES**: Create a gentle ghostly montage floating above the Store - translucent scenes of the good times:
- Corey cooking with joy
- Customers laughing and gathering
- Coffee steam rising from warm mugs
- Community moments and connection
- The life and love that happened here

**FAMILY SILHOUETTES**: In the foreground, show the family's silhouettes - clearly recognizable (Corey's bald head, Emily's short hair, three kids in graduated heights) looking back fondly before continuing their journey forward.

**THE FEELING**: This should have a gentle "THANK YOU" energy. The Store gave them three years of memories worth more than gold. It wasn't a failure or loss - it was simply a chapter, and now it's time to turn the page.

**THE WISDOM**: Include the message that this building has stood for over 200 years, has seen many chapters, and will see more. Each ending is just a new beginning.


 with brilliant, hopeful colors representing the final moments of this transformative story.

**IMAGE FORMAT**: Generate as a SQUARE image (1:1 aspect ratio).

**IMPORTANT VISUAL REQUIREMENT**: All characters must have expressive, detailed eyeballs - never just dots for eyes. Eyes should be large, expressive, and clearly defined with pupils and emotional detail.

**Art Style**: Modern 2D cartoon style with cel-shading featuring bold outlines, flat colors with cel-shading, clean prominent dark outlines, and sharp shadow edges without gradients.
