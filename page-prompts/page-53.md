Create a modern 2D cartoon illustration with cel-shading for the back cover showing a peaceful evening view.

**Main Image:**
Show The Store at Five Corners (reference: cartoon-characters/store-cartoon.jpg) from a distance, nestled peacefully at the five-way intersection. The historic building (cream siding, green shutters) glows softly with warm light in the windows. An American flag waves gently on the flagpole.

**Setting:**
Evening time with the Berkshire mountains silhouetted against a star-filled sky. The five roads stretch away in gentle curves into the distance, each leading toward different colored horizons suggesting infinite possibilities.

**Atmosphere:**
Peaceful and contemplative. The Store looks content and at rest—not abandoned, but ready for whatever comes next. Small details like a few cars parked nearby or soft light from the sunroom suggest ongoing life and possibility.

**Text Placement Areas:**
Leave clean space at the top for book description text and in the middle/lower areas for review quotes and series information.

**Visual Elements:**
- Soft evening colors (purples, deep blues, warm yellows from windows)
- Stars beginning to appear in the darkening sky
- Gentle suggestion that this is an ending that's also a beginning
- Maybe small silhouette of the family visible in one of the lit windows

**Overall Mood:**
Serene completion. The story has come full circle, but the sense of infinite possibility remains. This is a place where dreams continue, where every ending opens a new door.





**IMAGE FORMAT**: Generate as a SQUARE image (1:1 aspect ratio).

**IMPORTANT VISUAL REQUIREMENT**: All characters must have expressive, detailed eyeballs - never just dots for eyes. Eyes should be large, expressive, and clearly defined with pupils and emotional detail.

**Art Style**: Modern 2D cartoon style with cel-shading, emphasizing the peaceful, contemplative mood with soft evening lighting and a sense of stories continuing beyond the page.
