## IMAGE PROMPT

**COREY CHARACTER CONSISTENCY - MUST MATCH EXACTLY:**

Illustrate Corey EXACTLY matching the established reference character.

Corey is a late-middle-aged adult man (late 40s to 50s), bald with a high forehead,
clean-shaven, realistic facial structure.

MANDATORY CHARACTER CONSTRAINTS:
- Smaller, slightly tired eyes (NOT large or cute)
- Longer face, defined jawline
- Subtle age lines around eyes and mouth
- Head-to-body ratio realistic (no chibi, no mascot proportions)
- Neck visible and proportional
- Calm, warm smile (not exaggerated)

DO NOT:
- Do not make Corey look young
- Do not enlarge eyes
- Do not smooth facial features
- Do not shorten torso
- Do not stylize toward "cute" or "friendly mascot"

Style matches prior Corey reference sheets exactly.

Create a modern 2D cartoon illustration with cel-shading showing the climax of Book 3's career brainstorming.
**MAIN IMAGE**: MATTRESS TESTER COREY (bald!) in comfortable pajamas, sound asleep on a luxurious mattress with "ZZZ"s floating peacefully above him. Scientists in white lab coats surround the bed taking notes on clipboards marked "COMFY: ✓✓✓✓✓." A sign reads "DO NOT DISTURB - TESTING IN PROGRESS." This should clearly be the "best job ever" - getting paid to sleep!
**Remi with dark brown straight hair, blue Super3 t-shirt) should be visible making the suggestion with a yawn, clearly inspired by his own sleepiness.
**AROUND THE EDGES**: Create a swirling preview of MORE careers to come in Book 4! Include visual hints of:
- Water slides with splash effects
- Golf balls scattered about
- Hot dogs and food items
- Dogs in yoga poses
- Fortune cookies
- Mini golf windmills and obstacles
- Other whimsical career elements
**THE FAMILY** (Emily with short silver hair, Oona and Zephyr in Super3 shirts) should be visible watching, still bubbling with even more ideas, showing the brainstorming is nowhere near over.
Include "TO BE CONTINUED..." text to build excitement for Book 4's even wilder career suggestions.


 with dreamy, peaceful colors for the mattress testing scene (soft blues, comfortable whites) while the swirling career previews use bright, exciting colors that hint at the chaos to come in Book 4. The overall mood should be "sweet dreams... but MORE ADVENTURES AHEAD!"

**IMAGE FORMAT**: Generate as a SQUARE image (1:1 aspect ratio).

**IMPORTANT VISUAL REQUIREMENT**: All characters must have expressive, detailed eyeballs - never just dots for eyes. Eyes should be large, expressive, and clearly defined with pupils and emotional detail.

**Art Style**: Modern 2D cartoon style with cel-shading featuring bold outlines, flat colors with cel-shading, clean prominent dark outlines, and sharp shadow edges without gradients.
