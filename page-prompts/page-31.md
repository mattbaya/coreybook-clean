## PAGE TEXT
Corey paused for a moment, then said with a grin:
"Or maybe a LIBRARIAN! I could fit in!
An 'Open Scholarship and Research Data Services
Outreach Librarian'—how hard could THAT be?"

But Emily GLARED. "Stay in your LANE!"
So Corey said quickly, "Oh... maybe NOT, then."
## IMAGE PROMPT

**COREY CHARACTER CONSISTENCY - MUST MATCH EXACTLY:**

Illustrate Corey EXACTLY matching the established reference character.

Corey is a late-middle-aged adult man (late 40s to 50s), bald with a high forehead,
clean-shaven, realistic facial structure.

MANDATORY CHARACTER CONSTRAINTS:
- Smaller, slightly tired eyes (NOT large or cute)
- Longer face, defined jawline
- Subtle age lines around eyes and mouth
- Head-to-body ratio realistic (no chibi, no mascot proportions)
- Neck visible and proportional
- Calm, warm smile (not exaggerated)

DO NOT:
- Do not make Corey look young
- Do not enlarge eyes
- Do not smooth facial features
- Do not shorten torso
- Do not stylize toward "cute" or "friendly mascot"

Style matches prior Corey reference sheets exactly.

- COREY: Completely BALD adult male (no hair), round face, navy blue apron, white shirt
- EMILY: CAUCASIAN WHITE adult female, short silver pixie hair, black glasses
- REMI: 11-year-old CAUCASIAN WHITE boy, dark brown straight hair, blue Super3 shirt
- OONA: 11-year-old CAUCASIAN WHITE girl, long honey blonde hair, blue Super3 shirt
- ZEPHYR: 9-year-old CAUCASIAN WHITE girl, light brown shoulder-length hair, blue Super3 shirt
- SUPER3 LOGO: Red diamond shield with yellow "3", letters Z-O-R in corners
- STORE: Cream building with 4 white columns (reference: cartoon-characters/store-cartoon.jpg)
- TOTAL PEOPLE: Maximum 5 (Corey, Emily, Remi, Oona, Zephyr)

**FAMILY CONSISTENCY NOTE**: All family members (Corey, Emily, Remi, Oona, and Zephyr) are CAUCASIAN WHITE with the same light/pale skin tone. This is a white American family.


Create a modern 2D cartoon illustration with cel-shading as a TWO-PART PAGE with a dramatic contrast:
**TOP HALF - THE FANTASY**: COREY (bald!) imagining himself as a peaceful librarian in a beautiful library setting. He wears reading glasses and a cozy cardigan, holding a book titled "VERY COMPLICATED RESEARCH DATA." Towering bookshelves surround him, there's a "SHHH!" sign visible, and his desk nameplate shows the absurdly long title "Open Scholarship and Research Data Services Outreach Librarian." He looks content and intellectual.
**BOTTOM HALF - RECORD SCRATCH REALITY**: The fantasy POPS like a soap bubble! EMILY (short silver/gray pixie hair) is GLARING with arms crossed and one eyebrow raised. Her speech bubble reads "STAY IN YOUR LANE!" Corey (completely bald) looks sheepish with his hands up defensively, saying "Maybe not..." The transition should feel like a sudden reality check.
THE SUPER THREE (blue Super3 t-shirts) are visible in the corner, giggling at this family interaction:
- REMI (dark brown straight hair) trying not to laugh
- OONA (long honey blonde hair) with hand over mouth
- ZEPHYR (light brown messy hair) openly giggling
The key joke is that Emily IS an actual librarian in real life, so Corey suggesting HER profession is particularly presumptuous. The contrast between the peaceful fantasy and Emily's sharp reality check should be dramatic and funny.


 with the top half in soft, scholarly colors (warm browns, gentle yellows) and the bottom half with bold, dramatic colors emphasizing Emily's authoritative shutdown. The bubble-pop transition should be visually clear and comedic with sharp shadow edges.

**IMAGE FORMAT**: Generate as a SQUARE image (1:1 aspect ratio).

**IMPORTANT VISUAL REQUIREMENT**: All characters must have expressive, detailed eyeballs - never just dots for eyes. Eyes should be large, expressive, and clearly defined with pupils and emotional detail.

**Art Style**: Modern 2D cartoon style with cel-shading featuring bold outlines, flat colors with cel-shading, clean prominent dark outlines, and sharp shadow edges without gradients.
