Create a modern 2D cartoon illustration with cel-shading showing Corey in his kitchen during the peak success period, holding up his smartphone with pure joy and pride.

**Corey's Position & Expression:**
Show Corey (completely bald, navy blue apron, huge warm smile) standing confidently in his kitchen, holding his phone at eye level with both hands. His expression should show genuine delight and pride as he reads the reviews. His eyes should be sparkling with happiness, and his posture should be confident and proud.

**3D Holographic Phone Effects:**
The phone screen should emit a large, glowing 3D holographic **THUMBS UP** that appears to float above and out of the screen. Surrounding this should be floating **FIVE GOLD STARS** with sparkle effects.

**IMAGE FORMAT**: Generate as a SQUARE image (1:1 aspect ratio).

**IMPORTANT VISUAL REQUIREMENT**: All characters must have expressive, detailed eyeballs - never just dots for eyes. Eyes should be large, expressive, and clearly defined with pupils and emotional detail.

**Art Style**: Modern 2D cartoon style with cel-shading, bold outlines, flat colors with cel-shading, and special attention to the glowing, dimensional effects of the phone's holographic display. The scene should radiate success, validation, and joy - this is Corey at his peak, feeling appreciated for his hard work.
