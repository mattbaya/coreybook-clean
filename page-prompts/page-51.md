And YOU, reading this, if YOUR store ever closes,
If life throws you lemons (or worse—wilted roses),
If roundabouts ruin your road into town,
If bad water comes and your dreams start to drown...

**COREY CHARACTER CONSISTENCY - MUST MATCH EXACTLY:**

Illustrate Corey EXACTLY matching the established reference character.

Corey is a late-middle-aged adult man (late 40s to 50s), bald with a high forehead,
clean-shaven, realistic facial structure.

MANDATORY CHARACTER CONSTRAINTS:
- Smaller, slightly tired eyes (NOT large or cute)
- Longer face, defined jawline
- Subtle age lines around eyes and mouth
- Head-to-body ratio realistic (no chibi, no mascot proportions)
- Neck visible and proportional
- Calm, warm smile (not exaggerated)

DO NOT:
- Do not make Corey look young
- Do not enlarge eyes
- Do not smooth facial features
- Do not shorten torso
- Do not stylize toward "cute" or "friendly mascot"

Style matches prior Corey reference sheets exactly.

Create a modern 2D cartoon illustration with cel-shading BREAKING THE FOURTH WALL - directly addressing the reader with empathy and understanding.

**THE FAMILY (addressing reader):**
- All looking directly at the reader with compassionate expressions
- COREY (completely bald) with understanding, empathetic eyes
- EMILY with warm, supportive smile
- Children showing genuine care for the reader
- Reaching out toward the viewer as if to comfort

**SYMBOLIC ELEMENTS:**
- Storm clouds in background representing adversity
- Wilted roses scattered on the ground
- A cracked or broken road (roundabout damage)
- Muddy water puddles (E.coli reference)
- These challenges surround the family but don't overwhelm them

**MESSAGE OF UNDERSTANDING:**
- The family has been through these struggles too
- They're not preaching from privilege, but from experience
- Visual elements that show they understand real hardship
- Lemons scattered around that haven't been made into lemonade yet

**BREAKING THE FOURTH WALL:**
- Characters making direct eye contact with reader
- Gestures of invitation and support
- "We see you, we've been there" energy
- Bridge between story world and reader's reality

**IMAGE FORMAT**: Generate as a SQUARE image (1:1 aspect ratio).

**IMPORTANT VISUAL REQUIREMENT**: All characters must have expressive, detailed eyeballs - never just dots for eyes. Eyes should be large, expressive, and clearly defined with pupils and emotional detail.

**Art Style**: Modern 2D cartoon style with cel-shading featuring bold outlines, flat colors with cel-shading, clean prominent dark outlines, and sharp shadow edges without gradients.
