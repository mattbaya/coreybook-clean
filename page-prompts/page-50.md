# Page 50 - The Chef at the Store

## PAGE TEXT
The Store stood behind them, still lovely and old,
With three years of memories, worth more than gold.
And though they were leaving, they'd never forget
The place where their story began—not yet.

## IMAGE PROMPT

**COREY CHARACTER CONSISTENCY - MUST MATCH EXACTLY:**

Illustrate Corey EXACTLY matching the established reference character.

Corey is a late-middle-aged adult man (late 40s to 50s), bald with a high forehead,
clean-shaven, realistic facial structure.

MANDATORY CHARACTER CONSTRAINTS:
- Smaller, slightly tired eyes (NOT large or cute)
- Longer face, defined jawline
- Subtle age lines around eyes and mouth
- Head-to-body ratio realistic (no chibi, no mascot proportions)
- Neck visible and proportional
- Calm, warm smile (not exaggerated)

DO NOT:
- Do not make Corey look young
- Do not enlarge eyes
- Do not smooth facial features
- Do not shorten torso
- Do not stylize toward "cute" or "friendly mascot"

Style matches prior Corey reference sheets exactly.

- COREY: Completely BALD adult male (no hair), round face, navy blue apron, white shirt
- EMILY: CAUCASIAN WHITE adult female, short silver pixie hair, black glasses
- REMI: 11-year-old CAUCASIAN WHITE boy, dark brown straight hair, blue Super3 shirt
- OONA: 11-year-old CAUCASIAN WHITE girl, long honey blonde hair, blue Super3 shirt  
- ZEPHYR: 9-year-old CAUCASIAN WHITE girl, light brown shoulder-length hair, blue Super3 shirt
- SUPER3 LOGO: Red diamond shield with yellow "3", letters Z-O-R in corners
- STORE: Cream building with 4 white columns (reference: cartoon-characters/store-cartoon.jpg)
- TOTAL PEOPLE: Maximum 5 (Corey, Emily, Remi, Oona, Zephyr)

**FAMILY CONSISTENCY NOTE**: All family members (Corey, Emily, Remi, Oona, and Zephyr) are CAUCASIAN WHITE with the same light/pale skin tone. This is a white American family.

Create a modern 2D cartoon illustration with cel-shading showing the family looking back at the Store with fond memories.

**THE FAMILY (foreground):**
- Standing together on the road, turned to look back
- Expressions of gratitude and fond remembrance
- COREY (completely bald) with emotional smile
- EMILY with warm, reflective expression
- Children showing appreciation for their memories

**THE STORE (prominent background):**
- The Store at Five Corners looking beautiful and restored
- Cream building with 4 white columns clearly visible
- "The Store at Five Corners" sign bright and welcoming
- Golden late afternoon light on the building
- Represents the successful chapter of their lives

**MEMORY ELEMENTS:**
- Subtle ghostly/translucent images floating around the Store:
  - Corey cooking in the kitchen
  - Customers enjoying meals
  - Happy moments from their time there
- These should be soft and dreamlike, not overpowering

**ATMOSPHERE:**
- Bittersweet but hopeful
- Golden hour lighting
- Sense of closure and gratitude
- Looking back with love, not regret

**IMAGE FORMAT**: Generate as a SQUARE image (1:1 aspect ratio).

**IMPORTANT VISUAL REQUIREMENT**: All characters must have expressive, detailed eyeballs - never just dots for eyes. Eyes should be large, expressive, and clearly defined with pupils and emotional detail.

**Art Style**: Modern 2D cartoon style with cel-shading featuring bold outlines, flat colors with cel-shading, clean prominent dark outlines, and sharp shadow edges without gradients.
