# Page 42 - DECLARATION + TACKLE

## PAGE TEXT
"You're RIGHT!" Corey shouted. "This ISN'T the end!
The future's unwritten! The future is MINE!"
The Super Three cheered and they gave him a hug—
Or more like a TACKLE, like three little bugs!

**IMAGE FORMAT**: Generate as a SQUARE image (1:1 aspect ratio).

**IMPORTANT VISUAL REQUIREMENT**: All characters must have expressive, detailed eyeballs - never just dots for eyes. Eyes should be large, expressive, and clearly defined with pupils and emotional detail.

**Art Style**: Modern 2D cartoon style with cel-shading with the brightest, most hopeful colors of the entire series. The career possibilities should swirl like stars and planets, and the lighting should suggest the dawn of a new chapter. Maximum joy and possibility.
