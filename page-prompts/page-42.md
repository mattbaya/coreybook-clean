He looked at his family—his team and his crew.
At Emily's smile. At the Super Three too.
And something inside him switched ON like a light!
His shoulders un-slumped! And his frown became BRIGHT!

Create a modern 2D cartoon illustration with cel-shading showing THE TRANSFORMATION moment.

**SPLIT IMAGE TRANSFORMATION**: Show BEFORE and AFTER side by side:
- **LEFT SIDE**: Bald man Corey slumped, sad, shoulders down, in navy apron
- **RIGHT SIDE**: Same bald man standing tall, confident, huge smile, transformed

**FAMILY WATCHING**: All four family members watching proudly:
- **EMILY**: Silver pixie hair woman with warm smile
- **REMI**: Brown-haired boy in blue shirt, excited
- **OONA**: Blonde girl in blue shirt, clapping
- **ZEPHYR**: Smallest brown-haired girl in blue shirt, jumping

**TRANSFORMATION EFFECTS**:
- Golden warm light radiating from transformed Corey on right side
- Ghostly sad version fading away on left side
- Lightbulb glowing above his head showing the "switch ON" moment
- Warm golden background emphasizing the moment of realization





**IMAGE FORMAT**: Generate as a SQUARE image (1:1 aspect ratio).

**IMPORTANT VISUAL REQUIREMENT**: All characters must have expressive, detailed eyeballs - never just dots for eyes. Eyes should be large, expressive, and clearly defined with pupils and emotional detail.

**Art Style**: Modern 2D cartoon style with cel-shading with dramatic lighting effects. Use bright, vibrant colors for the transformed Corey and his family, while the ghostly past versions fade in muted tones. The light beam should be brilliant and hopeful, representing renewed life and confidence.
