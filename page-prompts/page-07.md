Create a modern 2D cartoon illustration with cel-shading showing a large tablet or screen displaying "The Greatest Hits" review compilation.

**Main Screen Display:**
Show a large tablet or computer screen prominently displaying a beautifully designed review compilation page titled "The Greatest Hits." The screen should have a professional, confident design with vibrant colors.

**Review Quotes - "The Greatest Hits" (Page 7 UNIQUE quotes):**
Theme: confident, celebratory, distilled praise
Visual style: fewer quotes, BIG type, poster-like design

Primary anchor (longest, most prominent):
- "We always enjoy coming here for coffee, a baked treat, and a cozy atmosphere."

Large supporting quotes (3):
- "Love this place. Great food in a sweet atmosphere."
- "The turkey sandwich is delicious!"
- "Excellent sandwiches."

Medium quotes (3):
- "Best sammies in town!"
- "Fantastic pizza, 100%!"
- "Awesome sandwich! Thanks."

**Design Elements:**
- Bold, celebratory typography
- Confident color scheme with vibrant accent colors
- Professional layout resembling a "greatest hits" compilation
- Mix of text sizes creating visual hierarchy
- Clean, organized presentation

**Background Setting:**
Show The Store's interior softly blurred in the background, with warm lighting from the screen illuminating the space. The tablet/screen should be the focal point, glowing prominently.

**Color Palette:**
Use confident, celebratory colors - deep blues, golden yellows, and vibrant greens that suggest success and quality. The screen should have a bright, inviting glow.

**IMAGE FORMAT**: Generate as a SQUARE image (1:1 aspect ratio).

**IMPORTANT VISUAL REQUIREMENT**: All characters must have expressive, detailed eyeballs - never just dots for eyes. Eyes should be large, expressive, and clearly defined with pupils and emotional detail.

**Art Style**: Modern 2D cartoon style with cel-shading featuring bold outlines, flat colors with cel-shading, clean prominent dark outlines, and sharp shadow edges without gradients.
