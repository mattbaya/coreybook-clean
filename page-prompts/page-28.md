## PAGE TEXT
"You could be a LEGO ENGINEER!" Oona cried out,
"Build a life-sized STATUE OF LIBERTY, no doubt!
Or a LEGO SEQUOIA—three hundred feet high!
And when people ask why, you'd say, 'LEGOS! That's why!'"
## IMAGE PROMPT

**COREY CHARACTER CONSISTENCY - MUST MATCH EXACTLY:**

Illustrate Corey EXACTLY matching the established reference character.

Corey is a late-middle-aged adult man (late 40s to 50s), bald with a high forehead,
clean-shaven, realistic facial structure.

MANDATORY CHARACTER CONSTRAINTS:
- Smaller, slightly tired eyes (NOT large or cute)
- Longer face, defined jawline
- Subtle age lines around eyes and mouth
- Head-to-body ratio realistic (no chibi, no mascot proportions)
- Neck visible and proportional
- Calm, warm smile (not exaggerated)

DO NOT:
- Do not make Corey look young
- Do not enlarge eyes
- Do not smooth facial features
- Do not shorten torso
- Do not stylize toward "cute" or "friendly mascot"

Style matches prior Corey reference sheets exactly.

**FAMILY CONSISTENCY NOTE**: All family members (Corey, Emily, Remi, Oona, and Zephyr) are CAUCASIAN WHITE with the same light/pale skin tone. This is a white American family.


Create a modern 2D cartoon illustration with cel-shading showing Oona's LEGO engineer fantasy sequence.
The main focus is LEGO ENGINEER COREY (completely bald!) wearing a hard hat and safety vest, standing proudly before MASSIVE LEGO STRUCTURES:
1. **Life-sized STATUE OF LIBERTY**: Built entirely from green LEGO bricks, with tourists taking photographs and a helicopter flying nearby for scale comparison. The statue should maintain its iconic pose but have that unmistakable blocky LEGO texture.
2. **300-FOOT LEGO SEQUOIA TREE**: A towering tree made of brown and green LEGO bricks stretching high into the clouds, with birds actually nesting in the LEGO branches.
On the ground around the structures:
- Scattered LEGO pieces that HURT to step on (show someone hopping on one foot yelling "OW!")
- Corey holding blueprints labeled "NEXT: LEGO GRAND CANYON?"
- A crowd of amazed people asking "WHY?" 
- Corey grinning widely and responding "BECAUSE LEGOS!"
In one corner, show OONA (long honey blonde hair, blue Super3 t-shirt) pointing excitedly at her suggested fantasy, clearly proud of this ambitious idea.
The scale should be massive and impressive, with Corey looking small but proud next to his creations. Include classic LEGO details like the studs on top of bricks and that satisfying blocky aesthetic.


 with bold outlines and bright primary colors that emphasize the LEGO aesthetic - lots of reds, blues, greens, and yellows in that blocky, satisfying LEGO style.

**IMAGE FORMAT**: Generate as a SQUARE image (1:1 aspect ratio).

**IMPORTANT VISUAL REQUIREMENT**: All characters must have expressive, detailed eyeballs - never just dots for eyes. Eyes should be large, expressive, and clearly defined with pupils and emotional detail.

**Art Style**: Modern 2D cartoon style with cel-shading featuring bold outlines, flat colors with cel-shading, clean prominent dark outlines, and sharp shadow edges without gradients.
