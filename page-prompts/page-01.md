## PAGE TEXT
At the corner of Five Roads (yes, five! Not just four!)
Stood a rickety, wonderful, old country Store.
It had stood there for ages—two hundred and MORE!
But it sat there all dusty. It sat there all sad.
The shelves were all empty. The windows looked bad.
## IMAGE PROMPT

Illustrate Corey EXACTLY matching the established reference character.

Corey is a late-middle-aged adult man (late 40s to 50s), bald with a high forehead,

- Calm, warm smile (not exaggerated)

DO NOT:
- Do not make Corey look young
- Do not enlarge eyes
- Do not smooth facial features
- Do not shorten torso
- Do not stylize toward "cute" or "friendly mascot"

Style matches prior Corey reference sheets exactly.

Create a modern 2D cartoon illustration with cel-shading showing The Store at Five Corners (reference: cartoon-characters/store-cartoon.jpg) looking abandoned but beautiful. The historic building has cream/yellow clapboard siding and dark forest green shutters. The "Store at Five Corners" sign with "Est. 1787" is visible but weathered. Show dusty windows with cobwebs, an empty front porch, and a small crooked "CLOSED" sign in the window. 

Five winding country roads stretch away from the intersection in different directions, creating the distinctive five-way crossroads. In the background, show the rolling Berkshire mountains with autumn colors. A red barn is visible across one of the streets. The sky should be gray and melancholy but not threatening.

The building should look lonely and neglected but waiting to be loved again—dusty and sad, but with inherent beauty and character. Add subtle Seussian touches like slightly wobbly rooflines and an exaggerated chimney, while maintaining the recognizable structure of this real historic building.





**IMAGE FORMAT**: Generate as a SQUARE image (1:1 aspect ratio).

**IMPORTANT VISUAL REQUIREMENT**: All characters must have expressive, detailed eyeballs - never just dots for eyes. Eyes should be large, expressive, and clearly defined with pupils and emotional detail.

**Art Style**: Modern 2D cartoon style with cel-shading featuring bold outlines, flat colors with cel-shading, clean prominent dark outlines, and sharp shadow edges without gradients. The mood should be melancholy but hopeful.
