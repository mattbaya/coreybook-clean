# Page 49 - The Chef at the Store

## PAGE TEXT
So out of Five Corners the family did walk—
All five of them laughing and having a talk.
The five roads stretched out to wherever they led,
But the family was TOGETHER—that's all that they said.

## IMAGE PROMPT

**COREY CHARACTER CONSISTENCY - MUST MATCH EXACTLY:**

Illustrate Corey EXACTLY matching the established reference character.

Corey is a late-middle-aged adult man (late 40s to 50s), bald with a high forehead,
clean-shaven, realistic facial structure.

MANDATORY CHARACTER CONSTRAINTS:

- Longer face, defined jawline
- Subtle age lines around eyes and mouth
- Head-to-body ratio realistic (no chibi, no mascot proportions)

- Calm, warm smile (not exaggerated)

DO NOT:
- Do not make Corey look young
