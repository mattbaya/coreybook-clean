## PAGE TEXT
(Okay, maybe not goo. That was Zephyr's idea.
But you get the whole point—the future was CLEAR!)
He looked at his family—his team and his crew.
At Emily's smile. At the Super Three too.
And something inside him switched ON like a light!
His shoulders un-slumped! And his frown became BRIGHT!

## IMAGE PROMPT

**CRITICAL CHARACTER CONSISTENCY - MUST MATCH EXACTLY:**
- COREY: Completely BALD adult male (no hair), round face, dark olive-green apron, white shirt
- EMILY: CAUCASIAN WHITE adult female, short silver pixie hair, black glasses
- REMI: 11-year-old CAUCASIAN WHITE boy, dark brown straight hair, blue Super3 shirt
- OONA: 11-year-old CAUCASIAN WHITE girl, long honey blonde hair, blue Super3 shirt

- TOTAL PEOPLE: Maximum 5 (Corey, Emily, Remi, Oona, Zephyr)

**FAMILY CONSISTENCY NOTE**: All family members (Corey, Emily, Remi, Oona, and Zephyr) are CAUCASIAN WHITE with the same light/pale skin tone. This is a white American family.

Create a modern 2D cartoon illustration with cel-shading showing THE TRANSFORMATION moment - Corey's realization and internal change.

**SPLIT IMAGE TRANSFORMATION**: Show BEFORE and AFTER side by side:
- **LEFT SIDE**: Bald man Corey slumped, sad, shoulders down, in navy apron
- **RIGHT SIDE**: Same bald man standing tall, confident, huge smile, transformed

**TRANSFORMATION EFFECTS**:
- Golden warm light radiating from transformed Corey on right side
- Ghostly sad version fading away on left side
- Lightbulb glowing above his head showing the "switch ON" moment
- Warm golden background emphasizing the moment of realization

**THE FAMILY UNIT**: All five together in a warm, loving composition:
- **EMILY** (short silver/gray pixie hair) with the light catching her hair, showing a knowing smile, her hand gently placed on Corey (completely bald)'s arm
- **Remi with dark brown straight hair, blue Super3 shirt) standing with arms crossed confidently
- **OONA** (long honey blonde hair, blue Super3 shirt) glowing and bouncing with natural joy
- **ZEPHYR** (light brown messy hair, blue Super3 shirt) looking up at her dad with pure adoration, still clutching her "GOO" drawing

**ATMOSPHERE**: The background should fade the career chaos into soft, warm golden light. This is a 100% FAMILY PORTRAIT moment - the focus entirely on love, support, and connection. The lighting should be golden hour warm, emphasizing that this family is Corey's true foundation.

**ZEPHYR'S DRAWING**: Still visible in her hand, labeled "GOO" - a sweet callback to her innocent suggestion while showing she's part of this loving support system.

The overall mood should be emotional clarity - after all the wild possibilities, the real treasure is right here with his family.





**IMAGE FORMAT**: Generate as a SQUARE image (1:1 aspect ratio).

**IMPORTANT VISUAL REQUIREMENT**: All characters must have expressive, detailed eyeballs - never just dots for eyes. Eyes should be large, expressive, and clearly defined with pupils and emotional detail.

**Art Style**: Modern 2D cartoon style with cel-shading with warm, golden lighting and soft focus around the edges. The family should be rendered in warm, loving colors that emphasize connection and support. This is the emotional center of the entire series.
