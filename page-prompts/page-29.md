## PAGE TEXT
"You could be an ACTOR on screens and TV!
You could star on 'The Bear'—you'd be great, don't you see?
Or be an IRON CHEF! Or a VAMPIRE so scary!
If you practiced real hard, you'd be the next Danny Kaye-ry!"
## IMAGE PROMPT

**COREY CHARACTER CONSISTENCY - MUST MATCH EXACTLY:**

Illustrate Corey EXACTLY matching the established reference character.

Corey is a late-middle-aged adult man (late 40s to 50s), bald with a high forehead,
clean-shaven, realistic facial structure.

MANDATORY CHARACTER CONSTRAINTS:
- Smaller, slightly tired eyes (NOT large or cute)
- Longer face, defined jawline
- Subtle age lines around eyes and mouth
- Head-to-body ratio realistic (no chibi, no mascot proportions)
- Neck visible and proportional
- Calm, warm smile (not exaggerated)

DO NOT:
- Do not make Corey look young
- Do not enlarge eyes
- Do not smooth facial features
- Do not shorten torso
- Do not stylize toward "cute" or "friendly mascot"

Style matches prior Corey reference sheets exactly.

- COREY: Completely BALD adult male (no hair), round face, navy blue apron, white shirt
- EMILY: CAUCASIAN WHITE adult female, short silver pixie hair, black glasses
- REMI: 11-year-old CAUCASIAN WHITE boy, dark brown straight hair, blue Super3 shirt
- OONA: 11-year-old CAUCASIAN WHITE girl, long honey blonde hair, blue Super3 shirt
- ZEPHYR: 9-year-old CAUCASIAN WHITE girl, light brown shoulder-length hair, blue Super3 shirt
- SUPER3 LOGO: Red diamond shield with yellow "3", letters Z-O-R in corners
- STORE: Cream building with 4 white columns (reference: cartoon-characters/store-cartoon.jpg)
- TOTAL PEOPLE: Maximum 5 (Corey, Emily, Remi, Oona, Zephyr)

**FAMILY CONSISTENCY NOTE**: All family members (Corey, Emily, Remi, Oona, and Zephyr) are CAUCASIAN WHITE with the same light/pale skin tone. This is a white American family.


Create a modern 2D cartoon illustration with cel-shading showing Corey's acting fantasy in FOUR PANELS:
**IMPORTANT**: DO NOT include any text labels like "PANEL 1", "PANEL 2", etc. in the actual image. These labels are for organization only.
**PANEL 1 - "THE BEAR"**: COREY (bald!) in intense kitchen scene wearing chef whites, shouting "YES CHEF!" with dramatic concentration. Include a clapperboard showing "THE BEAR" and the high-stress restaurant atmosphere.
**PANEL 2 - IRON CHEF**: COREY in the Iron Chef stadium with dramatic lighting and flames shooting from his cooking station. He's holding a weird ingredient (MARSHMALLOWS) and looking determined in the competition setting.
**PANEL 3 - VAMPIRE**: COREY in an awkward vampire costume with cape and fangs, fake blood on his chin, but looking more goofy than scary. A frustrated director off to the side is shouting "MORE SCARY!" while Corey tries harder to look menacing but fails adorably.
**PANEL 4 - DANNY KAYE**: COREY in old Hollywood musical style, tap dancing with a top hat, surrounded by stars and spotlights in classic theatrical fashion. He should look joyful and theatrical.
In the background of all panels, show THE SUPER THREE (blue Super3 t-shirts) holding "FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION" signs and cheering their dad on.
Each panel should capture a different acting genre while maintaining Corey's warm personality. The vampire scene should be particularly funny since he's clearly not cut out to be scary.


 with exaggerated expressions, bold panel borders, and bright stage lighting effects. Each panel should have its own color palette - kitchen whites/reds, stadium blues/oranges, gothic purples/blacks, and theatrical golds/reds.

**IMAGE FORMAT**: Generate as a SQUARE image (1:1 aspect ratio).

**IMPORTANT VISUAL REQUIREMENT**: All characters must have expressive, detailed eyeballs - never just dots for eyes. Eyes should be large, expressive, and clearly defined with pupils and emotional detail.

**Art Style**: Modern 2D cartoon style with cel-shading featuring bold outlines, flat colors with cel-shading, clean prominent dark outlines, and sharp shadow edges without gradients.
