# Page 02 - The Chef at the Store

Create a modern 2D cartoon illustration with cel-shading showing Corey approaching The Store at Five Corners (reference: cartoon-characters/store-cartoon.jpg) for the first time. Corey is BALD with a big warm smile, wearing his navy blue apron. He carries a comically large, teetering stack of shiny pots, pans, spatulas, and kitchen equipment that towers above his head in an unstable but charming way.

Corey has stars in his eyes and a huge grin showing his determination and excitement. His posture is eager with one foot already stepping toward the green front door of the Store. 

The Store is in the background—still dusty from the previous scene but now with a dramatic ray of golden sunshine breaking through the gray clouds and illuminating the building like a spotlight of destiny. This suggests that this meeting was meant to be.

A few curious townspeople peek from behind trees or from the red barn across the street, drawn by this enthusiastic newcomer. The five roads of the intersection converge on this moment of possibility.





**IMAGE FORMAT**: Generate as a SQUARE image (1:1 aspect ratio).

**IMPORTANT VISUAL REQUIREMENT**: All characters must have expressive, detailed eyeballs - never just dots for eyes. Eyes should be large, expressive, and clearly defined with pupils and emotional detail.

**Art Style**: Modern 2D cartoon style with cel-shading featuring bold outlines, flat colors with cel-shading, and clean prominent dark outlines. The mood shifts from the gray melancholy of the previous page to warm golden hope.
