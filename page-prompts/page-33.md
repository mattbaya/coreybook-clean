## IMAGE PROMPT

**COREY CHARACTER CONSISTENCY - MUST MATCH EXACTLY:**

Illustrate Corey EXACTLY matching the established reference character.

Corey is a late-middle-aged adult man (late 40s to 50s), bald with a high forehead,
clean-shaven, realistic facial structure.

MANDATORY CHARACTER CONSTRAINTS:
- Smaller, slightly tired eyes (NOT large or cute)
- Longer face, defined jawline
- Subtle age lines around eyes and mouth
- Head-to-body ratio realistic (no chibi, no mascot proportions)
- Neck visible and proportional
- Calm, warm smile (not exaggerated)

DO NOT:
- Do not make Corey look young
- Do not enlarge eyes
- Do not smooth facial features
- Do not shorten torso
- Do not stylize toward "cute" or "friendly mascot"

Style matches prior Corey reference sheets exactly.

- COREY: Completely BALD adult male (no hair), round face, navy blue apron, white shirt
- EMILY: CAUCASIAN WHITE adult female, short silver pixie hair, black glasses
- REMI: 11-year-old CAUCASIAN WHITE boy, dark brown straight hair, blue Super3 shirt
- OONA: 11-year-old CAUCASIAN WHITE girl, long honey blonde hair, blue Super3 shirt
- ZEPHYR: 9-year-old CAUCASIAN WHITE girl, light brown shoulder-length hair, blue Super3 shirt
- SUPER3 LOGO: Red diamond shield with yellow "3", letters Z-O-R in corners
- STORE: Cream building with 4 white columns (reference: cartoon-characters/store-cartoon.jpg)
- TOTAL PEOPLE: Maximum 5 (Corey, Emily, Remi, Oona, Zephyr)

**FAMILY CONSISTENCY NOTE**: All family members (Corey, Emily, Remi, Oona, and Zephyr) are CAUCASIAN WHITE with the same light/pale skin tone. This is a white American family.


Create a modern 2D cartoon illustration with cel-shading showing Corey's lawyer fantasy in a dramatic courtroom setting.
The main focus is LAWYER COREY (bald!) in a sharp suit, pointing dramatically at the defendant's table where EVIL CORPORATE EXECUTIVES cower. These villains should look cartoonish with money bag heads and suits made of dollar bills, representing mega-corporation greed.
Behind Corey: a line of GRATEFUL CLIENTS - chefs in aprons and small business owners looking relieved and thankful for his legal representation.
Key courtroom elements:
- Judge's nameplate reading "JUSTICE"
- Legal books on Corey's table: "FIGHTING THE POWER" and "LEASES FOR DUMMIES"
- A prominent business card: "COREY WENTWORTH, ESQ." in fancy script lettering
- A scoreboard showing "LITTLE GUYS: 47 / MEGA CORPS: 0"
The best detail: OONA (long honey blonde hair, blue Super3 t-shirt) wearing a tiny judge's wig and robes, seriously banging an oversized gavel from the judge's bench, fully committed to her role in this fantasy.
The scene should capture the David vs. Goliath energy of a small-town lawyer taking on corporate power and winning. Corey looks confident and principled, fighting for justice with the backing of the community.


 with dramatic courtroom lighting, bold contrast between the good guys (warm colors) and corporate villains (cold money-greens), and exaggerated expressions emphasizing the moral victory theme.

**IMAGE FORMAT**: Generate as a SQUARE image (1:1 aspect ratio).

**IMPORTANT VISUAL REQUIREMENT**: All characters must have expressive, detailed eyeballs - never just dots for eyes. Eyes should be large, expressive, and clearly defined with pupils and emotional detail.

**Art Style**: Modern 2D cartoon style with cel-shading featuring bold outlines, flat colors with cel-shading, clean prominent dark outlines, and sharp shadow edges without gradients.
