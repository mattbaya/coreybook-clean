## PAGE TEXT
The Store stood behind them, still lovely and old,
With three years of memories, worth more than gold.
It wasn't a failure—it wasn't a loss—
It was simply a chapter. Just turn the page, boss!

And YOU, reading this, if YOUR store ever closes,
If life throws you lemons (or worse—wilted roses),
If roundabouts ruin your road into town,
If bad water comes and your dreams start to drown...

## IMAGE PROMPT

**CRITICAL CHARACTER CONSISTENCY - MUST MATCH EXACTLY:**
- COREY: Completely BALD adult male (no hair), round face, dark olive-green apron, white shirt
- EMILY: CAUCASIAN WHITE adult female, short silver pixie hair, black glasses
- REMI: 11-year-old CAUCASIAN WHITE boy, dark brown straight hair, blue Super3 shirt
- OONA: 11-year-old CAUCASIAN WHITE girl, long honey blonde hair, blue Super3 shirt  
- ZEPHYR: 9-year-old CAUCASIAN WHITE girl, light brown shoulder-length hair, blue Super3 shirt
- SUPER3 LOGO: Red diamond shield with yellow "3", letters Z-O-R in corners
- STORE: Cream building with 4 white columns (reference: cartoon-characters/store-cartoon.jpg)
- TOTAL PEOPLE: Maximum 5 (Corey, Emily, Remi, Oona, Zephyr)

**FAMILY CONSISTENCY NOTE**: All family members (Corey, Emily, Remi, Oona, and Zephyr) are CAUCASIAN WHITE with the same light/pale skin tone. This is a white American family.

Create a modern 2D cartoon illustration with cel-shading BREAKING THE FOURTH WALL - directly addressing and welcoming the reader while honoring the past.

**MAIN FOCUS**: Looking BACK at the Store from the family's perspective as they pause in their journey forward. The Store at Five Corners (reference: cartoon-characters/store-cartoon.jpg) should glow warmly in the sunset - the cream siding appearing golden in the light, green shutters peaceful, the "Est. 1787" sign visible and honored.

**THE STORE'S DIGNITY**: The building should look peaceful and at rest, not abandoned or sad. It has dignity and beauty, ready for ITS next story too. This isn't about failure - it's about a chapter ending gracefully.

**HAPPY MEMORIES**: Create a gentle ghostly montage floating above the Store - translucent scenes of the good times:
- Corey cooking with joy
- Customers laughing and gathering
- Coffee steam rising from warm mugs
- Community moments and connection
- The life and love that happened here

**FAMILY SILHOUETTES**: In the foreground, show the family's silhouettes - clearly recognizable (Corey's bald head, Emily's short hair, three kids in graduated heights) looking back fondly before continuing their journey forward.

**THE FEELING**: This should have a gentle "THANK YOU" energy. The Store gave them three years of memories worth more than gold. It wasn't a failure or loss - it was simply a chapter, and now it's time to turn the page.

**THE WISDOM**: Include the message that this building has stood for over 200 years, has seen many chapters, and will see more. Each ending is just a new beginning.





**IMAGE FORMAT**: Generate as a SQUARE image (1:1 aspect ratio).

**IMPORTANT VISUAL REQUIREMENT**: All characters must have expressive, detailed eyeballs - never just dots for eyes. Eyes should be large, expressive, and clearly defined with pupils and emotional detail.

**Art Style**: Modern 2D cartoon style with cel-shading with warm, forgiving sunset colors - golds, soft oranges, peaceful purples. The memories should be rendered in soft, translucent style, and the overall mood should be gratitude and peace, not sadness.
